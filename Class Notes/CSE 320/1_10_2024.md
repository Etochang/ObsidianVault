>[!example] adding an array of 1000 numbers with another array of 1000 numbers
>Software:
>	C/Python program - CPU
>	CUDA/ROCm program - GPU
>Hardware:
>	Build a chip - ASIC
>	Connect existing chips on a circuit board or bread board
>	Use an FPGA

GPU (graphical processing unit) - built for mathematical functions

## Design Flow

### ASIC

### FPGA

### Class Information

The limitations of simulation is the lack of scenarios that can be tested.

## HDL

stands for **hardware description language**. 

### Verilog Compilation

1. Simulation
2. Synthesis
3. Implementation

## FPGAs

- Giant bread board miniaturized in a chip

### What is an ASIC❔

A chip made for a specific purpose. 

## Review of Digital Logic Design

### Combinational Logic

 
## Sequential Logic

J turns to 1
K turns to 0
JK flips the digit

 
T flips the digit

 
D turns the digit to one only when G is on at the same time
G turns the digit to 0, not when D is on

G = ENABLE

Propagational delay

### Finite State Machines

- Moore: outputs only depend on the present state.
- Mealy: outputs depend on both the present state and the present inputs
