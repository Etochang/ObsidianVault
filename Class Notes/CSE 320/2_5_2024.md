- Clock signal doesn't immediately switch to high or low

- Instead there is kind of a slope from 0 to 1.
- At the midpoint of each sloped line, that is when the computer switches from 0 to 1 and vice versa.
- 90% is clock, 10% is sloped line (propagation delay)
- Fall time
- High - 4.5 V, Low - 0.5V, in-between is propagation fall time.
- Pulse amplitude
- ![[Pasted image 20240205121329.png]]
- D comes after rising edge by a little.
- tsu -> setup time
	- time it takes for the input to be stable
	- setup violation
		- input changes when the clock rises/falls
- th -> hold time
	- input should NOT change during the hold time
- tplh -> propagational delay low to high
- tphl -> propagational delay high to low

## Timing Paths

- Register to register paths (Start at Q, end at D)
- Primary input to register paths (Start at A, end at D)
- Register to primary out paths (Start at Q, end at Z)
- Input direct out to out (Start at A, end at Z)

### Timing Rules for Flop to Flop Paths

- Rule 1
	- Data launched by FF1 on E1 of CLK1 should be captured by FF2 on E2 of CLK2
	- E1 = Edge 1
	- FF1 = Flip-Flop 1
- Tck = time clock period
- Tcmax = propagational delay of components
- Tpmax = propagational delay of input
- tpmax + tcmax < tck - tsu
- Slack - time that is leftover before causing time constraint
	- Critical path -> most combinational delays
- setup time <-> clock frequency
- Increase frequency -> reduce combo delays
- Chip has setup time violation -> run it at slower frequency

- Rule 2:
	- Data Launched by FF1 on E1 of CLK1 should not be captured by FF2 on E1 of CLK2

- tpmin + tcmin >= thold
- tccq = tpmin
- min combination delays = tcmin


Tc >= Tclk-q + Tpd + Tsetup
40 + Tpd + 20
40+35+20 = 95 ns = 10.5 MHz

10.5 < 11 MHz of clock

No set up violation
