## Blocking Statements -> Combinational Logic

```
always @ (posedge clk)
begin
	C = A && B;
	D = C || E;
	F = C ^ D;
end
```

- No concept of clock
- Executes sequentially
- Evaluates and assigns a statement before moving on to the next one

## Non-Blocking Statements -> Sequential Logic

```
always @ (posedge clk)
begin
	C <= A & B;
	D <= C | E;
end
```

- Evaluate all together, Assign all together
- Evaluate "before" the clock edge
- Assign "after" the clock edge

## Advice: Do not think like a C programmer

- Think hardware
- Think parallel
- Think concurrency
- Do not refer to your design as a "program"

## 'wire' and 'reg'

- `wire`: can be used if **only connection** is needed.\
	- only in modeling **combinational logic**.
	- **cannot be used** as the left-hand side element of an `=` or `<=` **in a procedural block**. 
	- The data type `wire` is the only legal type on the left-hand side of an `assign` statement.
- `reg`: used where the assigned data **needs to be stored** until the next assignment.
	- `reg` can be used to model **both combinational and sequential logic**.
	- `reg` is the only legal type on the left-hand side element of an `=` or `<=` **in a procedural block**. 
	- **cannot** be used on the left-hand side of an `assign` statement.
- If you want to assign your output in procedural code (e.g. in an always block), you should declare it as a **reg**. Otherwise, it should be a **wire** by default.

![[Pasted image 20240122122718.png]]
```
assign F = (~SEL && IN1) || (SEL && IN2);
```
or
```
assign F = (SEL) ? IN2 : IN1;
```

### Conditional Signal Assignment

- General Form:
```
assign signal_name = condition ? Tresult : Fresult
```

- Cascaded 2-to-1 mux:

```
assign F = (E) ? A : ((D) ? B : C);
```

- 4-to-1 mux:

```
assign F = (A) ? (B ? I3 : I2) : (B ? I1 : I0);
```

### Using CASE in always blocks

- General form:
```
case expression
	choice1: statements1
	choice2: statements2
	...
	[default: statements]
endcase;
```

Like a `dict` in python but for statements.

```
always @ (Sel or I0 or I1 or I2 or I3)
begin
	case Sel
		2'b00 : F = I0;
		2'b01 : F = I1;
		2'b10 : F = I2;
		2'b11 : F = I3;
	endcase;
end
```

### Using IF-ELSE in always blocks

General form:
```
if (condition)
	statements
else if (condition)
	statements
else
	statements
```

```
always @ (Sel or I0 or I1 or I2 or I3)
begin
	if (Sel == 2'b00) F = I0;
	else if (Sel == 2'b01) F = I1;
	else if (Sel == 2'b10) F = I2;
	else if (Sel == 2'b11) F = I3;
end
```

## Verilog Data Types and Operators

| Data Types | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| nets       | connections between hardware elements (declared with the keyword `wire`, `tri`, `wand`, `wor`)                                           |
| variables  | data storage elements that can retain values (declared with the keyword `reg`)                                                           |
| vectors    | `wire` or `reg` data types can be declared as vectors (multiple bits) (range1: range2)                                                   |
| integer    | a special variable data type (declared with the keyword `integer`)                                                                       |
| real       | a special variable type, real number constants and real register data types for floating-point number (declared with the keyword `real`) |
| time       | a special variable type to store time information (declared with the keyword `time`)                                                           | 

Verilog is a **[[typing system#Weak Typing|weakly typed]]** language. 

## Sequential Logic

### Modeling Flip-Flops

```
always @ (posedge clk)
begin
	Q <= D;
end
```

>[!note]
>Flip-flops change state on the edge of the clock input.  This type of behavior is modeled in Verilog by an `always`. **Positive edge is used above**.

>[!example] Verilog code for a latch
>```
>always @ (G or D)
>begin
>	if (G)
>		Q <= D;
>end
>```

>[!example] Verilog code for D flip-flop with asynchronous reset/clear
>
>```
>always @ (posedge clk or negedge clearN)
>begin
>	if (~clearN)
>		Q <= 0;
>	else
>		Q <= D;
>end
>```
>
>Since the asynchronous `clearN` signal overrides `clk`, `clearN` is tested first and the flip-flop is cleared if 
>`clearN == 0`;

>[!example] Verilog code for a D flip-flop with synchronous reset/clear
>
>```
>always @ (posedge clk)
>begin
>	if (~clearN)
>		Q <= 0;
>	else
>		Q <= D;
>end
>```

>[!example] Verilog code for a JK flip-flop with async reset/set
>```
>module JKFF(SN, RN, J, K, clk, Q, Qn);
>input SN, RN, J, K, clk;
>output Q, Qn;
>
>reg Qint;
>
>always @ (negedge clk or RN or SN)
>begin
>	if (~RN)
>		#8 Qint <= 0;
>	else if (~SN)
>		#8 Qint <= 1;
>	else
>		#10 Qint <= (J && ~Qint) || (~K && Qint);
>end
>
>assign Q = Qint;
>assign Qn = ~Qint;
>
>endmodule
