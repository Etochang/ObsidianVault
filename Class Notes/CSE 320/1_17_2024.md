## Class Overview part 2

- Expanding on knowledge from CSE 120
- Using FPGAs
- Learning Verilog
- Hands-on Experience

## Example: Simple Circuit w/ Gates

```
assign C = A && B;
assign E = C || D;
```

>[!important]
>Each gate has a **5 ns** propagation delay:

```
assign #5 C = A && B;
```

Exercise:

```
assign #2 D = A && B;
assign #1 E = ~A;
assign #3 F = A || C;
```

In Verilog, use **vectors**(bit vectors), not arrays.

```
wire [3:0] B;
assign B = 4'b1100;
// Assigns '1' to B[3], 
// '1' to B[2], 
// '0' to B[1], 
// '0' to B[0]
```

Exercise:

```
wire [3:0] A;
wire [3:0] B;

assign C = A & B;
```

>[!important]
>Use `&` for vectors.

### General Structure of a Verilog module

```
module module-name (module interface list);
[list of interface ports] //Input/output

[port declarations] //Internal signals

[functional specification of module]

endmodule
```

>[!example] Verilog module with 2 gates
>```
>module two_gates (A, B, D, E);
>output E;
>input A, B, D;
>
>wire C;
>
>assign C = A && B;
>assign E = C || D;
>
>endmodule
>```

## MODE

- Mode indicates **direction of information**
	- in: only used as input
	- out: only used as output
	- inout: used both as input and output

## Module Instantiations

> Do not refer to them as "calls", they are **instances**.

## 1-bit Full Adder

Inputs: X, Y, Cin
Outputs: Cout, Sum

```
module full_adder_1 (X, Y, Cin, Cout, Sum);
output Cout, Sum;
input X, Y, Cin;

assign Sum = X ^ Y ^ Cin;
assign Cout = (X && Y) || (X && Cin) || (Y && Cin);

endmodule
```

## 4-bit Full Adder

```
module full_adder_4 (A, B, S, Ci, Co);
output [3:0] S;
output Co;
input [3:0] A, B;
input Ci;

wire [3:1] C; //like an array

full_adder_1 FA0 (A[0], B[0], Ci, C[1], S[0]);
full_adder_1 FA1 (A[1], B[1], C[1], C[2], S[1]);
full_adder_1 FA2 (A[2], B[2], C[2], C[3], S[2]);
full_adder_1 FA3 (A[3], B[3], C[3], Co, S[3]);
```

### Named Association:

```
module full_adder_4 (A, B, S, Ci, Co);
output [3:0] S;
output Co;
input [3:0] A, B;
input Ci;

wire [3:1] C; //like an array

full_adder_1 FA0 (.X(A[0]), .Y(B[0]), .Cin(Ci), .Cout(C[1]), .Sum(S[0]));
full_adder_1 FA1 (.X(A[1]), .Y(B[1]), .Cin(C[1]), .Cout(C[2]), .Sum(S[1]));
full_adder_1 FA2 (.X(A[2]), .Y(B[2]), .Cin(C[2]), .Cout(C[3]), .Sum(S[2]));
full_adder_1 FA3 (.X(A[3]), .Y(B[3]), .Cin(C[3]), .Cout(Co), .Sum(S[3]));
```

## Verilog Assignments/Blocks

- Continuous
	- Used to assign values for [[combinational logic circuit|combinational logic circuits]]
- Procedural
	- Used to assign values for [[sequential logic circuit|sequential logic circuits]], as well as combinational logic circuits.
### Continuous Assignments

Always ready to execute; gets evaluated **any time** and **every time** a signal on the right side of the statement changes.

- Explicit continuous assignment
	- `assign` keyword can be used after the net is **separately** declared
- Implicit continuous assignment
	- assign the value in declaration **without** using the `assign` keyword.

>[!example] Explicit
>```
>wire C;
>assign C = A || B;
>```

>[!example] Implicit
>```
>wire C = A || B;
>```

### Procedural Assignments

- `initial` blocks execute only once at time zero
- `always` blocks execute over and over again every time a signal in the sensitivity list changes.

`always` block **waits for the event**, `initial` block just executes all the statements without **waiting**. 

>[!example] `initial`
>```
>initial
>begin
>	(sequential)statements
>end
>```

>[!example] `always`
>```
>always @(sensitivity-list)
>begin
>	(sequential)statements
>end
>```

#### Statements in a Procedural Block

- Statements are executed sequentially but with different semantics depending on the operator used.

```
always @(A, B, D)
begin
	C = A && B; // = vs <= explained below
	E = C || D;
end
```

#### Blocking and Non-Blocking Assignments

- **blocking**: operator '=' is used for representing the blocking assignment.
	- **Must complete** the execution of a statement *before* next statements in a sequential block get executed.
	- Evaluation happens now. Assignment happens now.
	- Execution = Evaluation + Assignment
- **non-blocking**: operator '<=' is used for representing the non-blocking assignment.
	- Allows to execute statements without blocking the sequential flow. In other words, several statements can be **evaluated** at the same time.
	- Evaluations happens now. Assignment happens later.

#### Combinational Logic in "always"

Can use always block for combinational logic, but use blocking statements.

```
module two_gates(A, B, C, D, E);
input A, B, C;
output D, E;

reg D, E;

always @(*)
begin
	D = A || B; // assign D = A || B;
	E = C || D; // assign E = C || D;
end

endmodule
```
