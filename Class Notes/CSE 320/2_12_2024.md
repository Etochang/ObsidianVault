## Simple Digital System Components

>[!important] A commonly used term - RTL
>Register Transfer Level:
>- Describes the hardware as a flow of data from one set of registers to the next at each clock cycle.
>RTL is somewhere in between behavioral and structural
>- Behavioral -> may not be able to synthesize
>- Structural -> too tedious

Levels of Abstraction: Functionality -> Behavioral -> Structural -> Layout

Controller -> based on state diagrams, has state machines, CPU, GPU, FPGA, TPU
Data Path -> based on Computational unit, has arithmetic circuits, memory/storage

## Design Methodology

- Read the specification (can be vague)!
- Draw a block diagram
	- Separate functionality into meaningful blocks
	- Mark I/Os. Mark the computation/control happening in each block.
- Block Level
	- Design -> Verify -> Synthesize
- Top Level
	- Connect Blocks -> Verify
- Synthesize and Implement

## Debouncing

Software -> no extra components, but still has electric arcing
Hardware -> extra components, but no electric arcing

## Single Pulser 

Convert Human Action to Single Clock Cycle Pulse.

## 7-Seg Display
