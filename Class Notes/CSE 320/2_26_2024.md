>[!example] Parity Bits
>If number of 1s is even, set $P_{od} = 1; P_{ev} = 0$, and vice versa if number of 1s is odd. The former is ODD parity and the latter is EVEN parity.

How to use the Parity Bits:


- Field Programmable Devices
	- FPGA
	- DPLD
	- SPLD
		- PLA
		- PAL
		- GAL
		- PROM
- Factory Programmable Devices
	- MPGA
	- ROM

|                  | SPLD        | CPLD          | FPGA           |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Density/Size** | Low         | Low to Medium | Medium to High |
| **Timing**       | Predictable | Predictable   | Unpredictable  |
| **Cost**         | Low         | Low to Medium | Medium to High |

- Many Ways to Implement Combinational Circuits
	- NAND, NOR
	- MUXs
	- Decoders
	- ROMs (LUTs)
- Programmable Logic Device
	- Puts different programmable building blocks in chip

LSB at bottom

encoder -> input value matches output value, from decimal i to binary abc

ROM -> Word 0: 010101, Word 1: 011001...
word # corresponds to row, the binary value corresponds to the connections for each column, column # corresponds to # of bits. Lattice shape.

- ROM - Read Only Memory
- PROM - (User) Programmable ROM (but once)
- EPROM - Erasable PROM (by UV)
- EEPROM - Electrically Erasable PROM
- Flash - Particular Type of EEPROM

PAL -> AND array is programmable, OR array is fixed
PLA -> OR array is programmable, AND array is fixed

| Cheap                          | Average                         | Very Expensive                 |
| Fixed AND                      | AND is programmable             | AND and OR are programmable    |
| OR is programmable             | Fixed OR                        |                                |
