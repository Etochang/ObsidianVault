>[!example] 1, 0, X, Z
>0 - represents a logic zero, or a false condition
>1 - represents a logic one, or a true condition
>x - represents an unknown logic value
>z - represents a high-impedance state

High-impedance: high resistance, low current

## Initial Value of Wire and Reg
| Wire | Regs |
| ---- | ---- |
| The initial value of a wire is z (high impedance) | The initial value of a reg is x (unknown) |
## Reset
- Using `initial`
```
initial
begin
	state <= 0;
end
```

>[!warning]
>Not synthesizable, only use in testbench code.

- Using a reset signal on your design
```
module mydesign(...);
input x, clk, reset;
output y;

always @(posedge clk) begin
	if (reset) begin
		state <= 0;
	end else begin
		case (state)
			0: begin
				if (x==0) state <= 1;
				else state <= 2;
			1: begin
				if (x==0) state <= 3;
				else state <= 2;
			......
		endcase
	end
end

endmodule
```

## Simulation

- to verify that Verilog code correctly implements the design
- to verify that the Verilog code can handle edge cases
- to verify that the design meets its specifications

## Definitions

### Processes

- `initial`
- `always`
- `assign` statements

### Event

- Evaluation event -> involve processing or evaluating signal values. These events often enter update events into the queue.
- Update (or Assignment) event -> Involve assignment (i.e. change in signal values). In turn enable evaluation events that are sensitive to the changed signal

### Event queue

- Events are kept in an event queue
- Need to process them in the right order
- Putting an event in the queue is called "scheduling an event"

### Time

- Simulation time

## Verilog stratified event queue

5 Regions:
- Active
	- Blocking assignments
	- Evaluate RHS of NBAs
	- assign statements
	- $display commands
- Inactive
	- \#0 blocking assignments
	- Can trigger active
- NBA
	- Update LHS of NBAs
	- Can trigger active
- Monitor/Postponed
	- Smonitor commands
	- Sstrobe commands
- Future

## Scheduling Implication of Assignments

When each Verilog statement is processed, events are added to the various queue regions according to the following convention for each type of statement:
- Continuous assignment
- Blocking assignment w/ delay
- Blocking assignment w/ 0 delay
- Blocking assignment w/o delay
- Non-blocking assignment w/o delay
- Non-blocking assignment w/ delay
