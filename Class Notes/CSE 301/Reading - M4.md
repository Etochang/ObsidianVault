## 2-9 Social Contract Theory

### The Social Contract

- Thomas Hobbes

>Without rules and a means of enforcing them, people wouldn't bother to create anything of value, because nobody could be sure of keeping what they created.

"state of nature" - miserable condition of being consumed with taking what is needed and defending against the attacks of others

To avoid "the state of nature", cooperation is essential - but it is only possible when people mutually agree to follow certain guidelines.

- moral rules are "simply the rules that are **necessary** if we are to gain the benefits of social living."

Hobbes argues that everybody living in a civilized society has implicitly agreed:
1. the establishment of such a set of moral rules to govern relations among citizens and
2. a government capable of enforcing these rules
This is the **social contract**.

- Jean-Jacques Rousseau continued the evolution:
	- "Since no man has any natural authority over his fellows, and since force alone bestows no right, all legitimate authority among men must be based on covenants."
To summarize:
- Let the community decide on rules (indirectly is like applying moral rule universally, since an unfair rule towards others would also be unfair towards the maker of the rule).

>In order for the social contract to function, society must provide not only a system of laws but a system of enforcing the laws as well.

>[!info] Social Contract Theory
 >Morality consists in the set of rules, governing how people are to treat one another, that rational people will agree to accept, for their mutual benefit, on the condition that others follow those rules as well.

"Hobbes, John Locke, and many other philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries held that all morally significant beings have certain rights, such as the right to life,
liberty, and property. Some modern philosophers would add other rights to this list, such as
the right to privacy."

- There is a close correspondence between rights and duties
- right to life -> others have the duty to not kill you
- right to free health care -> others have duty to make sure you receive it

- **negative right:** a right that another can guarantee by leaving you alone to exercise your right
	- the right of free expression; others just have to not interfere with you when you express yourself
- **positive right:** a right that obligates others to do something on your behalf
	- the right to a free education; the rest of society must allocate resources so that you may attend school
- **absolute right:** a right that is guaranteed without exception. Negative rights, such as the right to life, are usually considered absolute rights.
- **limited right:** a right that may be restricted based on the circumstances. Positive rights are typically considered to be limited rights (the right to an education).

### Rawls's Theory of Justice

- John Rawls
- "To be well ordered, a society must establish the rights and duties of its members and also determine a just way of distributing 'the benefits and burdens of social cooperation'."
- **veil of ignorance**

>[!info] John Rawls's Principles of Justice
>1. Each person may claim a "fully adequate" number of basic rights and liberties, such as freedom of thought/speech, freedom of association, the right to be safe from harm, and the right to own property, so long as these claims are consistent with everyone else having a claim to the same rights and liberties.
>2. Any social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions: first, they are associated with positions in society that everyone has a fair and equal opportunity to assume; and second, they are "to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle)".

2nd principle:
- every person in society should have an equal chance to assume a position of higher standing
- **difference principle:** social and economic inequalities must be justified (with benefits)

When analyzing, think of the rights of the rational agents involved.

### The Case For

1. It is framed in the language of rights
2. It is based on a solid understanding of human nature, recognizing that rational people act out of self-interest in the absence of a common agreement; it is based on the idea that morality is the result of an implicit agreement among rational beings who understand that there is a tension between self-interest and the common good
3. It explains why under certain circumstances civil disobedience can be the morally right decision

### The Case Against

1. None of us signed the social contract
2. Some actions can be characterized in multiple ways
3. It doesn't explain how to solve a moral problem when the analysis reveals conflicting rights
4. It may be unjust to those people who are incapable of upholding their side of the contract

## 2-10 Virtue Ethics

*arete* - virtue/excellence

### Virtues and Vices

- Aristotle
- **intellectual virtues:** virtues associated with reasoning and truth
- **moral virtues:** habits/dispositions formed through the repetition of the relevant virtuous actions.

>a moral virtue isn't simply a disposition to *act* in a particular way, it is also a disposition to *feel* in a particular way.

>[!summary] Virtue Ethics
>A right action is an action that a virtuous person, acting in character, would do in the same circumstances. A virtuous person is a person who possesses and lives out the virtues. The virtues are those character traits human beings need in order to flourish and be truly happy.

**vice:** a character trait that prevents a human being from flourishing or being truly happy. The opposite of virtues.

- two different vices can be associated with a virtue: one corresponding to an excess and the other to a deficiency.

- analyze from the perspective of facilitating and obstructing the acquirement of virtues

### The Case For

1. In many situations it makes more sense to focus on virtues than on obligations, rights, or consequences
2. Personal relationships can be morally relevant to decision making
3. Virtue ethics recognizes that our moral decision-making skills develop over time
4. Virtue ethics recognizes the important role that emotions play in living a moral life

### The Case Against

1. Different people may have quite different conceptions of human flourishing
2. Virtue ethics cannot be used to guide government policy
3. Virtue ethics undermines attempts to hold people responsible for their bad actions

## 2-11 Comparing Workable Ethical Theories

- All mentioned theories share the viewpoint that moral good and moral precepts are objective. In other words, morality has an existence outside the human mind. Philosophers call this view **ethical objectivism**.

- act utilitarianism is based on individual actions
- Kantianism, rule utilitarianism, and social contract theory are based on rules
	- Kantian relies upon the Categorical Imperative
	- rule utilitarian considers the long-term consequences of everyone following the rule, total utility
	- social contract theory considers whether rational people would agree to accept the rules, for everyone's mutual benefit, provided that everyone else agreed to follow the rule as well
- virtue ethics focuses on the agent, not on the act or consequences of the act

## 2-12 Morality of Breaking the Law

### Social Contract Theory
- our obligation to obey the law should be broken only if we are compelled to follow a higher-order moral obligation
### Kantian
- failing to obey the law would be failing to fulfill your obligation to others as a member of civil society
### Rule Utilitarianism
- Obey the law unless (1) the laws doesn't maximize utility, and (2) you have good reason to believe that the long-term net effect of breaking the law will be greater utility
### Act Utilitarianism
- It is possible that there are circumstances where the benefits of a single instance of breaking a law are greater than the harms

## Summary

- Society's guidelines are morality
- Ethics rationally studies morality
- Ethical relativism is the idea that people invent morality
- Ethical objectivism is the idea that morality exists outside the human mind
- Kantianism: every human being is equally valuable, and every interaction with another should respect that person's rationality and autonomy
- Utilitarianism: it's helpful to consider the consequences of an action or rules when deciding whether it is right or wrong
- Social Contract Theory: focuses on the individual and collective benefits of protecting certain human rights
- Virtue Ethics: based on the idea that you can count on a good person to do the right thing at the right time in the right way
