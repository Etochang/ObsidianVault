>Chapter 6

## 6-1 Introduction

Daniel Solove's taxonomy of privacy:
1. **information collection** - activities that gather personal information
2. **information processing** - activities that store, manipulate, and use personal information that has been collected
3. **information dissemination** - activities that spread personal information
4. **invasion** - activities that intrude upon a person's daily life, interrupt a person's solitude, or interfere with someone's decision-making.

## 6-2 US Legislation Restricting Information Collection

### Employee Polygraph Protection Act

EPPA of 1988 prohibits most private employers from using lie-detector tests under most situations.

The exceptions include pharmaceutical companies and security firms in certain job categories. Also, employers who have suffered an economic loss may do so as well to suspects. Most significantly, EPPA doesn't apply to federal, state, and local governments

### Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

COPPA in 2000 is designed to reduce the amount of info gathered from children using the Internet. According to COPPA, online services must obtain parental consent before collecting any info from children 12 yo and younger.

### Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act

The GINA of 2008 is designed to prevent discrimination in the areas of medical benefits and employment based on genetic information.

It prohibits health insurance companies and health plan administrators from requesting genetic information from individuals or their family members, and it forbids them from using genetic information when making decisions about coverage, rates, or preexisting conditions. It also prohibits most employers from taking genetic info into account when making employment decisions.

The law doesn't extend these protections to life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance, and it doesn't apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees.

## 6-3 Information Collection by the Government

### Census Records

In order to ensure each state has fair representation in the House of Representatives, the US Constitution requires the government to perform a census every 10 years.

According to federal law, the Census Bureau is supposed to keep the information it collects confidential. However, in times of national emergency, the Census Bureau has revealed its info to other agencies.

### Internal Revenue Service Records

In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment gave the U.S. the power to collect an income tax, and the IRS now collects more than $2 trillion a year in taxes.

Your income tax form may reveal a tremendous amount of personal info about your income, your assets, the organizations to which you give charitable contributions, your medical expenses, and much more.

### FBI National Crime Information Center 2000

NCIC is a collection of databases supporting the activities of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the U.S., the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Canada.

Today, NCIC databases contain 12 million records in 21 databases, which include such categories as wanted persons, criminal histories, people incarcerated in federal prisons, convicted sex offenders, unidentified persons, people believed to be a threat tot eh president, foreign fugitives, violent gang members, and suspected terrorists. 

Successes of NCIC:
- provided the info to find James Earl Ray, killer of MLK
- helped find a lot of wanted persons, arrest a lot of criminals, find a lot of missing people, and retrieve a lot of stolen cars
- Help arrest criminals correctly

Privacy violations of innocent people:
- can lead law enforcement agencies to arrest innocent persons
- innocent people have been arrested because their name is the same as ones in the database
- NCIC has been used to keep records about people not suspected of any crime, such as opponents of the Vietnam War
- Corrupt employees have sold info to private investigators and altered/deleted records
- People with access to the NCIC have illegally used it to search for criminal records on acquaintances or to screen potential employees, such as babysitters

### OneDOJ Database

provides state and local police access to info supplied by five federal law enforcement agencies: the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Bureau of Prisons. It stores incident reports, interrogation summaries, and other info not presently available through the NCIC. 

### Closed-Circuit Television Cameras

The NYCLU has expressed opposition to the large increase in security cameras, saying that they present a violation of privacy and won't prevent terrorist attacks.

Great Britain, suicide bombings in the London subway system in 2005.

### License-Plate Scanners

Police credit them with helping them find stolen vehicles and solve criminal cases. 

The length of time that police departments retain the license-plate info varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.

### Police Drones

Possible uses include searching for missing persons, surveying storm damage to isolate neighborhoods, controlling illegal immigration, pursuing fugitive criminals, and performing surveillance at large public gatherings.

Numerous cities and states are currently debating what controls, if any, should be placed on the use of drones by police.

## 6-4 Covert Government Surveillance

>[!info] Fourth Amendment
>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

### Wiretaps and Bugs

**Wiretapping** - the interception of a telephone conversation

It was a popular tool for catching bootleggers during Prohibition. Federal agents caught Roy Olmstead though wiretapping, and Olmstead appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment protected tangible assets alone.

The public and the press were critical of the Supreme Court decision. In 1934, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Communications Act, which (among other things) made it illegal to intercept and reveal wire communications. 3 years later, the Supreme Court used the FCA to reverse its position on warrantless wiretaps.

The FBI continued to wiretap secretly, but because it knew evidence obtained through wiretapping was inadmissible in court, the FBI began maintaining 2 sets of files: the official files that contained legally obtained evidence, and confidential files containing evidence obtained from wiretaps and other confidential sources.

A **bug** is a hidden microphone used for surveillance. In a series of decisions, the US Supreme Court gradually came to an understanding that citizens should also be protected from all electronic surveillance conducted without warrants, including bugs.

### Operation Shamrock

During WWII, the US Government censored all message entering and leaving the country. At the end of the war, the Signal Security Agency asked companies to break federal law in the interest of national security by requesting them to allow them to make photographic copies of all foreign government telegram traffic that entered, left, or transited the U.S.

In 1961, Robert Kennedy became the new attorney general of the U.S., and he immediately focused on organized crime. He convened a meeting in which investigators from the FBI, IRS, SEC, etc., could exchange information. The Justice Department gave the names of hundreds of alleged crime figures to the NSA, asking that these figures be put on its "watch list".

During the Vietnam War, the Johnson and Nixon administrations hypothesized that foreign governments were controlling/influencing the activities of American anti-war groups.

In 1969, the NSA became an active participant in the war on drugs.

Facing hostile congressional and press scrutiny, the NSA called an end to Operation Shamrock in May 1975.

### Carnivore Surveillance System

developed by the FBI in the late 1990s to monitor Internet traffic. Discontinued usage in 2001, was replaced by commercial software capable of performing the same function.

### Covert Activities After 9/11

#### NSA Wiretapping

Early in 2002, the CIA captured several top al-Qaeda members, along with their PCs and cell phones. The NSA used the numbers from these to eavesdrop.

#### Talon Database

The Thread and Local Observation Notices database, made in 2003. The purpose was to collect reports of suspicious activities or terrorist threats near military bases.

Was shut down on September 17, 2007 because it contained a lot of information that wasn't related to terrorists

## 6-5 US Legislation Authorizing Wiretapping

### Title III

allows a police agency that has obtained a court order to tap a phone for up to 30 days.

### Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

FISA provides for judicial and congressional oversight of the government's covert surveillance of foreign governments and their agents. The law allows the president to authorize electronic surveillance of foreign nationals for up to one year without a court order, as long as there is little chance that the surveillance will reveal the contents of communications with any US citizens. If communication with US citizens are to be monitored, the government must get a court order from the FISA court.

FISA was amended by the Protect America Act of 2007, which allows the US government to tap communications beginning or ending in a foreign country without oversight by the FISA court.

### Electronic Communications Privacy Act

ECPA allows police to attach 2 kinds of surveillance devices to a suspect's phone line. If the suspect makes a phone call, a **pen register** displays the number being dialed. If the suspect gets a phone call, a **trap-and-trace device** displays the caller's phone number. 

It also allows police to conduct **roving wiretaps** - wiretaps that move from phone to phone - if they can demonstrate the suspect is attempting to avoid surveillance by using many different phones.

### Stored Communications Act

Under this law, the government doesn't need a search warrant to obtain from an ISP email messages more than 180 days old. 

Many companies/organizations have joined forces to form an organization called Digital Due Process, which is lobbying Congress to update the ECPA. The view is that the government shouldn't be able to obtain an email message, document, or photo from an Internet/cloud service provider without a proper search warrant.

### Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act

CALEA of 1994 was passed in response to new tech, and it required that networking equipment used by phone companies be designed or modified so that law enforcement agencies can trace calls, listen in on telephone calls, and intercept email messages.

## 6-6 USA PATRIOT Act

Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism

### Provisions

1. Providing federal law enforcement and intelligence officials with greater authority to monitor communications
2. Giving the Secretary of the Treasure greater powers to regulate banks, preventing them from being used to launder foreign money
3. Making it more difficult for terrorists to enter the US
4. Defining new crimes and penalties for terrorist activity

The Patriot Act expands the kinds of info that law enforcement officials can gather with pen registers and trap-and-trace devices. It allows police to use pen registers on the internet to track email addresses and URLs. 

The Patriot Act extends the jurisdiction of court-ordered wiretaps to the entire country. It also allows the nationwide application of court-ordered search warrants for terrorist-related investigations.

The Patriot Act broadened the number of circumstances under which roving surveillance can take place. It allows it to be performed for the purpose of intelligence, and the government doesn't have to prove that the person under investigation actually uses the device to be tapped. Additionally it doesn't require that the agency report back to the authorizing judge regarding the number of devices monitored and the results of the monitoring.

Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement officials wishing to intercept communications to and from a person who has illegally gained access to a computer system don't need a court order if they have the permission of the owner of the computer system.

The Patriot Act allows courts to authorize law enforcement officer to search a person's premises w/o first serving a search warrant when there is "reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the warrant may have an adverse effect". Officers may seize property that "constitutes evidence of a criminal offense in violation of the laws of the U.S.", even if that offense is unrelated to terrorism.

### National Security Letters

The Patriot Act expanded the use of National Security Letters, making it easier for the FBI to collect Internet, business, medical, educational, library, and church/mosque/synagogue records. To obtain a search warrant authorizing the collection of records about an individual, the FBI merely needs to issue a NSL stating that the records are related to an ongoing investigation. These are controversial because unlike warrants, they don't require the approval of a judge.

### Responses to the Patriot Act

- its provisions give too many powers to the federal government
- concerns that law enforcement agencies may use their new powers to reduce the rights of law-abiding Americans, particularly those rights expressed in the First and Fourth Amendments to the US Constitution.

First Amendment rights center around the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. 

Critics maintain that other provisions of the Patriot Act undermine the right against unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment:
- it allows police to install Internet pen registers w/o demonstrating probable cause that the suspect is engaged in criminal activity.
- it allows for court orders authorizing roving surveillance that don't "particularly describe the place to be searched."
- it allows agencies, under certain circumstances, to search homes and seize evidence w/o first serving a search warrant.
- it allows the FBI to obtain - without showing probable cause - a warrant authorizing the seizure of business, medical, educational, and library records of suspects.

### Successes and Failures

Successes:
- has helped the government in its fight against terrorism by allowing greater info sharing among law enforcement and intelligence agencies
- has given them new investigative tools

Failures:
- have affected innocent bystanders (Brandon Mayfield incident)

### Long-Standing NSA Access to Telephone Records

2013, the *Guardian* revealed that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) has ordered Verizon to provide to the NSA on a daily basis records of all of its customers' calls. These call records, also called **telephony metadata**, included a lot of identifying info. 

The USA Freedom Act in 2015 put new restrictions on the government's surveillance activities. In particular, it shifted the bulk collection of telephone records to the phone companies and required government agencies to obtain a court order before accessing them.

## 6-7 Regulation of Public and Private Databases

### Code of Fair Information Practices

In the early 1970s, Elliot Richardson, the secretary of the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, convened a group to recommend policies for the development of government databases that would protect the privacy of American citizens.

>[!info] Code of Fair Information Practices
>1. There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret
>2. There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the person is in a record and how it is used
>3. There must be a way for a person to prevent info about the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without the person's consent
>4. There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about the person
>5. Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data

### Privacy Act of 1974

it represents Congress's codification of the Code of Fair Information Practices, and has the following principal limitations:
1. it applies only to government databases
2. it only covers records indexed by a personal identifier
3. no one in the federal government is in charge of enforcing the provisions of the Privacy Act
4. it allows one agency to share records with another agency as long as they are for a "routine use"

### Fair Credit Reporting Act

passed in 1970 and revised in 1996, was designed to promote the accuracy and privacy of info used by credit bureaus and other consumer reporting agencies to produce consumer reports. It also ensures that negative info doesn't haunt a consumer for a lifetime.

### Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act

Requires the 3 major credit bureaus to provide consumers a free copy of their credit report every 12 months. Consumers must take the initiative and request them from AnnualCreditReport.com.

The law also has provisions to reduce identity theft. It requires the truncation of account numbers on credit card receipts, and it established the National Fraud Alert System.

### Financial Services Modernization Act

contains dozens of provisions related to how financial institutions do business. One of the major provisions of the law allows the creation of "financial supermarkets" offering banking, insurance, and brokerage services.

It also requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies to their customers. The institution must notify the customer annually about what kinds of info it collects and how it uses that info. These notices must contain an opt-out clause that explains to customers how they can request that their confidential info not be revealed to other companies. It also requires that institutions develop policies that prevent unauthorized access to their customers' confidential info.

## 6-8 Data Mining by the Government

### IRS Audits

To identify taxpayers who have paid less than they owe, the IRS uses computer-matching and data-mining strategies.

### Syndromic Surveillance Systems

protecting society from imminent danger. It analyzes 911 calls, visits to the ER, school absenteeism, purchases of prescription drubs, and Internet searches to find patterns that might indicate the onset of an epidemic, an environmental problem leading to illnesses, or bioterrorism.

### Telecommunications Records Database

The NSA analyzed calling patterns in order to detect potential terrorist networks. 

### Predictive Policing

the use of data mining to deploy police officers to areas where crimes are more likely to occur.

### Potential Harms of Profiling

Erroneous conclusions, reputations, implications for individual mischaracterized.

## 6-9 National Identification Card

### History and Role of the SSN

The Social Security Act of 1935 established 2 social insurance programs in the US. Before they could be implemented, employers/workers needed to become registered. In this way, over 35 million Social Security cards were issued in 1936-1937.

The US government initially stated that SSNs would be used solely by the Social Security Administration and not as a national identification card. However, use of the SSN has gradually increased. Nowadays, the SSN has become a de facto national identification number in the US.

Unfortunately, the SSN has serious defects that make it a poor identification number. The first problem with SSNs is that they are not unique. The second is that they are rarely checked. A third is that they have no error-detecting capability, such as a check digit at the end of the number.

### Debate over a National ID Card

Proponents:
1. it would be more reliable than existing forms of identification
2. it could reduce illegal immigration
3. it would reduce crime
4. it doesn't undermine democracy

Opponents:
1. it doesn't guarantee that the apparent identity of an individual is that person's actual identity
2. it is impossible to create a biometric-based national identification card that is 100 percent accurate
3. there is no evidence that the institution of a national ID card would lead to a reduction in crime
4. a national identification card makes it simpler for government agencies to perform data mining on the activities of citizens
5. law-abiding people are subject to fraud and the indiscretions and errors of others

### The REAL ID Act

Requires that every state issue new driver's licenses. These licenses will be needed in order to open a bank account, fly on a commercial airplane, enter a federal building, or receive a government service, such as a Social Security check.

Supporters say that it makes the driver's license a more reliable identifier and will:
- make law enforcement easier
- etc.

Critics fear that having machine-readable info on driver's licenses will aggravate problems with identity theft.

Proponents say that the personal info available on the new driver's license is relatively insignificant compared to all the other personal info circulating around cyberspace.

## 6-10 Information Dissemination

### Family Education Rights and Privacy

FERPA provides students 18 yo and older the right to review their educational records and to request changes to records that contain erroneous information. They also have the right to prevent info in these record from being released without their permissions, except under certain circumstances. For students under 18 yo, these rights are held by their parents/guardians.

### Video Privacy Protection Act

video providers cannot disclose rental records without the written consent of customers. In addition, organizations must destroy personally identifiable information about rentals within a year of the date when this info is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected.

### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

These limit how doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and insurance companies can use medical info collected from patients.

The regulations attempt to limit the exchange of info among health care providers to that info necessary to care for the patient.

### Freedom of Information Act

designed to ensure that the public has access to US government records. 

### Tollbooth Records Used in Court

E-ZPass records used by states.

## 6-11 Invasion

### Telemarketing

The FTC created the National Do Not Call Registry, a free service that allows people who don't wish to receive telemarketing calls to register their phone numbers. www.donotcall.gov

The regulations exempt political organizations, charities, and organizations conducting telephone surveys. 

### Loud Television Commercials

CALM Act required the FCC to ensure that television commercials are played at the same volume as the programs they are interrupting.

### Requiring ID for Pseudoephedrine Purchases

In order to curb the illegal production of meth, the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act limits the quantity of pseudoephedrine that an individual can purchase in a month.

### Advanced Imaging Technology Scanners

TSA implemented advanced imaging technology (AIT) scanners in 2007. In 2013, the TSA announced that all body scanners producing passenger-specific images would be removed from airports later that year.
