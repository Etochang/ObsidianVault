> 2.1, 2.6-2.8

## 2-1 Introduction

Communities:
- make people more secure against external dangers
- facilitate the exchange of goods and services
- individuals can focus on specialization, resulting in higher productivity that increases the average standard of living
- foster the development of fulfilling personal relationships

The price:
- communities prohibit certain actions and make other actions obligatory
- not conforming means liable to be punished

>[!info] the ethical point of view
>Understanding that other people and their core values are worthy of respect.

### Defining Terms

>[!note] society
>An association of people organized under a system of rules designed to advance the good of its members over time. (Religion, nation, group of any kind)

>[!info] morality
>Rules of conduct (in a society) describing what people ought and ought not to do in various situations.

>[!info] ethics
>The philosophical study of morality, a rational examination into people's moral beliefs and behavior.

- The rational, systematic analysis of conduct that can cause benefit or harm to other people.

## 2-6 Kantianism

- Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804)
- Believed that people's actions ought to be guided by moral laws, and that these moral laws were universal.
- In order to apply to all rational beings, any supreme principle of morality must itself be based on reason.
- A Kantian is able to go beyond simply stating that an action is right or wrong by citing chapter and verse; a Kantian can explain *why* it is right or wrong.

### Good Will and the Categorical Imperative

- Anything but **good will** can be used for nefarious purposes.
- Thus, the only thing that is universally good is the **good will**, no matter the results of someone acting on that good will.
- Thus, the proper function of reason is to cultivate a will that is good.

Our sense of "ought to" is called **dutifulness**.

The moral values of an action depends upon the underlying moral rule; it is critical, therefore, that we be able to determine if our actions are grounded in an appropriate moral rule.

An **imperative** is a way in which reason commands the will.
- **hypothetical imperative**: a conditional rule of the form, "If you want X then do Y". It explains the means you should take to achieve a particular end.
- **categorical imperative**: an unconditional rule: a rule that always applies, regardless of the circumstances. For Kant, only a categorical imperative can be a moral imperative.

>[!info] Categorical Imperative (First Formulation)
>Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws.

>[!info] Categorical Imperative (Second Formulation)
>Act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only as a means to an end.
- ignores extenuating circumstances

### The Case For

1. It treats all persons as moral equals
2. It gives all persons moral worth by considering them as rational, autonomous beings
3. Everyone is held to the same standard
4. Kantianism produces universal moral guidelines

### The Case Against

1. Sometimes, no single rule fully characterizes an action
2. Sometimes, there is no way to resolve a conflict between rules
	- Kant distinguished between **perfect duties** and **imperfect duties**, ones we are obliged to fulfill in every instance and ones we aren't.
3. Kantianism allows no exceptions to perfect duties.

## 2-7 Act Utilitarianism

- Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill
- an action is good if its benefits exceed its harms, and an action is bad if its harms exceed its benefits
- based upon the principle of utility, also called the Greatest Happiness Principle.
### Principle of Utility

>**Utility** is the tendency of an object to produce happiness or prevent unhappiness for an individual or a community. 

>[!info] Principle of Utility
>An action is right (or wrong) to the extent that it increases (or decreases) the total happiness of the affected parties.

The morality of an action has nothing to do with the attitude behind the action.

Utilitarianism is a **consequentialist** theory, because the focus is on the consequences of an action.

**Act utilitarianism** is the ethical theory that an action is good if its net effect (over all affected beings) is to produce more happiness than unhappiness.

>An important decision an act utilitarian must make is determining which beings are considered to be morally significant.

Bentham acknowledged that a complete analysis must look beyond simple benefits and harms. Not all benefits have equal weight. To measure them, he proposed seven attributes that can be used to increase or decrease the weight of a particular pleasure or pain:

- **Intensity**: magnitude of the experience
- **Duration**: how long the experience lasts
- **Certainty**: probability it will actually happen
- **Propinquity**: how close the experience is in space and time
- **Fecundity**: its ability to produce more experiences of the same kind
- **Purity**: extent to which pleasure is not diluted by pain or vice versa
- **Extent**: number of people affected

### The Case For

1. It focuses on happiness
2. It is practical
3. It is comprehensive

### The Case Against

1. When performing the utilitarian calculus, it isn't clear where to draw the line, yet where we draw the line can change the outcome of our evaluation
2. It isn't practical to put so much energy into every moral decision
3. Act utilitarianism ignores our innate sense of duty
4. We cannot predict with certainty the consequences of an action
5. Act utilitarianism is susceptible to the problem of moral luck
	- *Is it right for the moral worth of an action to depend solely on its consequences when these consequences aren't fully under the control of the moral agent?*

## 2-8 Rule Utilitarianism

### The Basis

**Rule utilitarianism** is the ethical theory that holds that we ought to adopt those moral rules that, if followed by everyone, leads to the greatest increase in total happiness over all affected parties.

- a rule utilitarian applies utility to moral rules
- an act utilitarian applies utility to individual moral actions

### The Case For

1. Not every moral decision requires performing the utilitarian calculus.
2. Exceptional situations do not overthrow moral rules
3. Rule utilitarianism solves the problem of moral luck
4. Rule utilitarianism reduces the problem of bias
5. Appeals to a wide cross section of society

### The Case Against

1. utilitarianism forces us to use a single scale/measure (example: dollars) to evaluate completely different kinds of consequences.
2. ignores the problem of an unjust distribution of good consequences
	1. Solution? we should act so that the greatest amount of good is produced
	2. we should distribute the good as widely as possible.
