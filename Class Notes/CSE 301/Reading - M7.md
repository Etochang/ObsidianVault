## 4-5 Digital Media

### Digital Rights Management

DRM refers to any of a variety of actions owners of IP may take to protect their rights. DRM tech may be incorporated into an OS, a program, or a piece of hardware.

### Digital Millennium Copyright Act

DMCA, passed by Congress in 1998, was the first major revision of US copyright law since 1976. The primary purpose of the DMCA was to bring the US into compliance with international copyright agreements it had signed.
- It makes it illegal for consumers to circumvent encryption schemes placed on digital media
- it is illegal to sell or even discuss online a software program designed to circumvent copy controls.
The DMCA requires Internet radio stations to make royalty payments to the copyright holders of music they broadcast.

### Secure Digital Music Initiative

SDMI was an effort to create copy-protected CDs and secure digital music downloads that would play only on SDMI-compliant devices.

It was unsuccessful for 3 reasons:
- before any copy-protection tech could be put in place, the number of music files being copied on the Internet mushroomed
- some of the sponsors of the SDMI - consumer electronics companies - started making a lot of money selling devices that became more attractive to customers as access to free MP3 files got easier. Their sales could be hurt by restrictions on copying
- The digital watermarking scheme was cracked by Princeton CS professor Edward Felten and eight colleagues

### Sony BMG Music Entertainment Rootkit

Extended Copy Protection from Sony BMG Music Entertainment secretly installed a rootkit on Windows when the CD was played for the first time. A **rootkit** is a way of hiding files and processes from users.

### Criticisms of DRM

Many experts suggest that any tech 'fix' to the problem of copyright abuse is bound to fail. 

Others argue that DRM undermines the well-established principle of fair use.

DRM restriction sometimes prevent libraries from reformatting materials to make the more accessible to the disabled

DRM protections never expire

Some DRM schemes prevent people from anonymously accessing content.

### Online Music Stores Drop DRM

Apple used to use FairPlay when it first began selling music through iTunes in 2003, but around 2007-2009 other competitors began offering songs w/o DRM, and Apple followed suit.

### Microsoft Xbox One

Three feature of the proposed cloud-based gaming experience were particularly controversial:
- a disc owner would be allowed to share a disc only once
- freedom to sell discs and buy secondhand titles was restricted
- Xbox consoles would have to check in online every 24 hours to ensure that the authorized software was up-to-date and that there was no unauthorized software

## Peer-to-Peer Networks and Cyberlockers

**peer-to-peer** refers to a transient network allowing computers running the same networking program to connect with each other and access files stored on each other's hard drives. 
- they give each user access to data stored in many other computers
- they support simultaneous file transfers among arbitrary pairs of computers
- they allow users to identify those systems that will be able to deliver the desired data more rapidly, perhaps because they have a faster Internet connection or are fewer routing hops away

**Cyberlockers** (also called **file-hosting services** or **cloud storage services**) are Internet-based file-sharing services that allow users to upload password-protected files. 

### RIAA Lawsuits Against Napster, Grokster, and Kazaa

They were P2P networks that facilitated the exchange of music files.

RIAA sued Napster into shutting down, and Grokster/Kazaa were heavily affected by court orders.

### MGM v. Grokster

Because Grokster and StreamCast advertised to users implying that using their services for copyright infringement was ok, they were liable for the infringement that happened, unlike the situation with the time-shifting Sony Betamax VCR

### BitTorrent

- Downloading a file is about 10x faster than uploading one
- A problem with FastTrack and some other P2P network protocols is that when one peer computer shares a file w/ another, the file is transferred at the slower upload speed rather than the faster download speed.
- BitTorrent divides a file into pieces about a quarter-megabyte in length. Different pieces of a file can be downloaded simultaneously from different computers, avoiding the bottleneck that occurs when the entire file is uploaded from a single computer.
- BitTorrent gives priority to users who upload from their machines
- Download speeds increase the more peers get a title.

### Legal Action Against the Pirate Bay
Government action taken but they still survive

### PRO-IP Act

In 2008, the US Congress passed the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act. Gives federal law-enforcement agencies the authority to seize the domain names of Websites that are allegedly facilitating copyright infringement or trafficking in counterfeit goods.

### Megaupload Shutdown

In 2012, the FBI worked with police in New Zealand and Hong Kong to shut down the Megaupload cyberlocker and arrest its founder, Kim Dotcom and three associates for violating the PRO-IP Act.

### Legal Online Access to Entertainment

Piracy has pressured companies into making obtaining a legal copy of their products as easy as pirating them (or easier). 

Now, the popularity of downloading has started to decline, as consumers shift from ownership toward anytime-anywhere access offered by streaming services.

## 4-7 Protections for Software

### Software Copyrights

The first software copyrights were applied for in 1964. 

Copyright protects the original expression of an idea but not the idea itself. The implementation, not the concept.

Copyright usually protects the executable program, not the source program.

### Violations of Software Copyrights

1. Copying a program onto a CD to give or sell to someone else
2. Preloading a program onto the hard disk of a computer being sold
3. Distributing a program over the Internet

Another type of copyright violation can occur when a company attempts to create software that competes with an existing product:

#### Apple Computer v. Franklin Computer

Franklin ACE used OS functions directly from a ROM on the Apple II to make programs compatible. Apple won.

#### Sega v. Accolade

Accolade wanted to port some of its games to the Sega Genesis, so they disassembled the object code of a Sega game in order to determine how to interface a video game with the game console. Accolade won.

### Safe Software Development

An organization must be careful not to violate the copyrights held by its competitors; even unconscious copying can have serious consequences.

A "clean-room" software development strategy helps ensure a company's software program doesn't duplicate any code in another company's product. In this strategy, two teams work on the project; the first is responsible for determining how it works, and the other is isolated from the first to develop, code, and debug the new software solely from technical specification from the first team.

####  Oracle v. Google

Java API declarations were copied by Google. Oracle sued them after acquiring Sun Microsystems and Java. Oracle eventually won because Google copied way more than they needed to implement Android.

### Software Patents

|                                       | Software Copyright              | Software Patent                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| What is protected?                    | Object program, screen displays | Software process with practical utility |
| Is getting protection expensive?      | No                              | Yes                                     |
| Is getting protection time consuming? | No                              | Yes                                     |
| Is reverse engineering allowed?       | Yes                             | No                                      |

#### Origins

US Supreme Court forced the Patent and Trademark Office to issue patent for software.

Companies generate revenue by licensing their patents to other companies. It's also common for several tech companies to hold patents that cover different but essential components of a commercial product.

#### Patent-Holding Companies

**patent trolls:** patent-holding companies that aggressively use the courts to enforce their patent rights. Because defending against a patent-infringement lawsuit can easily exceed a million dollars, companies that get sued have a strong motivation simply to settle out of court, putting patent trolls "in a position to negotiate licensing fees that are grossly out of alignment with their contribution to the alleged infringer's products or services."

#### Harms From Too Many Software Patents

A problem faced by patent examiners in the Patent and Trademark Office is knowing what the existing technical knowledge in computer programming is.

The consequence is that patent examiners have issued many "bad patents" - patents that wouldn't have been issued if the examiner knew about the technical knowledge.

The Patent Office has also been criticized for granting patents for trivial inventions that would be obvious to any skilled computer programmer.

As a consequence of the sheer volume of software patents, the large number of bad patents, and the number of obvious software inventions that are patented, any company releasing a new product that includes software runs a significant risk of being sued for infringing a software patent owned by someone else.

#### Smartphone Wars

Suing war.

#### Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank

In order for an abstract idea to be patentable, there must be an "inventive concept"; simply implementing an abstract idea on a computer is not sufficient.

In another decision, Williamson v. Citrix Online, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit set a precedent for other courts to strike down software patents that are determined to be "too broad and indefinite".

## 4-8 Legitimacy of IP Protection for Software

### Rights-Based Analysis

Not everyone can program, and programming is hard work. Programmers who write good programs should be rewarded for their labor. That means that they should own their own programs. Ownership implies control; if somebody creates a piece of software, he/she has the right to decide who gets to use it. Software owners ought to be able to charge others for using their programs. Everybody ought to respect these IP rights.

**Criticisms:**
- Why does mixing your labor with something mean that you own it? Doesn't it make just as much sense to believe that if you mix your labor with something you lose your labor?
- IP is different from physical property: ownership is way different

### Utilitarian Analysis

When software is copied, it reduces software purchases. If less software is purchases, less money flows to the producers of software. As a result, less new software is produced. As a whole, new software titles benefit society. When the number of new titles drops, society is harmed. Therefore, when software is copied, society is harmed, and copying software is wrong.

![[Pasted image 20240603130027.png]]

- First claim: It is fair to say that copying software sometimes results in reduced sales, but it is not always the case. Hence, it is incorrect to make a universal statement.
- Second claim: Open-source disproves the cause-and-effect relationship of software creation with financial remuneration; customers are not solely responsible for the health of the software industry.
- Third claim: hard to prove

### Conclusion

The arguments for granting IP protection for software are not strong. Nevertheless, our society has granted copyright protection to owners of computer programs. 

## 4-9 Open-Source Software

In the early years of commercial computing, there was no independent software industry. Well into the 1960s, software distributions included the source code. Customers who wanted to fix bugs in the programs or add new features could do so by modifying the source code and generating a new executable version of the program.

Today, companies developing proprietary software tightly control the distribution of their intellectual property.

### Consequences of Proprietary Software

Benefits
- The ability to profit from the licensing of the software. The assumption is that people will work harder and be more creative if they must compete with others to produce the best product.

Harms
- Digital tech has made copying trivial. In order to enforce copyrights in the digital age, increasingly harsh measures are being taken. These measures infringe on our liberties. 
- The purpose of the copyright system is to promote progress, not to make authors wealthy. Copyrights are not promoting progress in the computer software field.
- It is wrong to allow someone to "own" a piece of IP. Granting someone this ownership forces the users of a piece of IP to choose between respecting ownership rights and helping their friends.

The **open-source** movement is the philosophical position that source code to software ought to be freely distributed and that people should be encouraged to examine and improve each other's code.

### Definition

1. There are no restrictions preventing others from selling/giving away the software
2. The source code to the program must be included in the distribution or easily available by other means
3. There are no restrictions preventing people from modifying the source code, and derived works can be distributed according to the same license terms as the original program
4. There are no restrictions regarding how people can use the software
5. These rights apply to everyone receiving redistributions of the software without the need for additional licensing agreements
6. The license cannot put restrictions on other software that is part of the same distribution. For example, a program's open-source license cannot require all the other programs on the CD to be open source.

### Beneficial Consequences of Open-Source

1. It gives everyone using a program the opportunity to improve it. People can fix bugs, add enhancements, or adapt the program for entirely new uses. Software evolves more quickly when people are working on it.
2. New versions of open-source programs appear much more frequently than new versions of commercial programs
3. It eliminates the tension between obeying copyright law and helping others
4. Open-source programs are the property of the entire user community, not just a single vendor
5. It shifts the focus from manufacturing to service, which can result in customers getting better support for their software

### Examples

- BIND provides DNS for the entire Internet
- Apache runs about half of the world's Web servers
- The most widely use program for moving email about the Internet is the open-source program sendmail
- The Android OS is the world's best-selling smartphone platform
- Chrome is the world's most popular Web browser, and Firefox is the number-four browser

### The GNU Project and Linux

They are the most important success stories in the history of the open-source movement. 

Richard Stallman began the GNU project in 1984. The goal was to develop a complete Unix-like OS consisting of open-source software.

In 1991 Linus Torvalds began work on a Unix-like kernel he named Linux. He released version 1.0 of the kernel in 1994. 

### Impact

Linux has become a viable alternative to proprietary versions of Unix. 

## 4-10 Creative Commons

Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig realized there was a need for a system that would allow producers of IP to indicate to the world the rights they wanted to keep. 

Lessig joined with Hal Abelson, James Boyle, Eric Eldred, and Eric Saltzman to found the nonprofit Creative Commons in 2001. They provide standard copyright licenses free of charge. Every license comes in three forms: human-readable, lawyer-readable, and computer-readable. With a Creative Commons license, you can retain the copyright while allowing some uses of your IP under certain circumstances.
