## Introduction

How do automation, globalization, AI, and "winner-take-all" effects transform our workplaces/communities?

- How has automation affected the pool of jobs?
- Does globalization really provide more benefits than harms?
- Will breakthroughs in AI lead to significant job losses?
- Should we be concerned about the rising number of temporary jobs and the emergence of the "gig economy"?
- Is there a "digital divide," an opportunity gap, between those who have access to IT and those who don't?
- Do we need to be concerned about "winner-take-all" effects that are leading to a concentration of wealth?

## 10-2 Automation and Employment

### Automation and Job Destruction

Automation has been blamed for the loss of both manufacturing and white-collar jobs, as well as an increase in the length of the workweek for salaried employees.

#### Lost Manufacturing Jobs

- Manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 with 19.4 million jobs
- 2011, dropped 40 percent to 11.7 million even though US population had increased by 39 percent
- 2016, only 8 percent
- meanwhile, productivity has increased

#### Lost White-Collar Jobs

- email, voice mail, and high-speed copy machines eliminate secretarial and clerical positions. Even jobs requiring advanced degrees are vulnerable.

#### Working Harder, Making Less

- Harvard economist Juliet Schor reports that between 1970 and 1990, the average American increased the number of hours spent at work per year by 163. That's equal to an extra month at work every year.
- Some believe this is a consequence of corporate downsizing, which is facilitated by automation and IT.
- Advances in IT have also made it easier for people to bring work home. 

### Automation and Job Creation

#### Increased Purchasing Power

- Automation is introduced as a cost-saving measure
- Lower production costs result in lower prices
	- increases demand; workers must be hired because of increased demand
	- people get reduced prices, which lets them spend more on other products which in turn increases their demand
- Also, people need to be hired to created the automated devices themselves

#### Working Less, Making More

Martin Carnoy disputes the notion that people are working longer hours now than they used to. “Workers today,” he writes, “work much less than those of a century ago, produce more, earn substantially more, and have access to a greater variety of jobs. Technology displaced workers but also contributed to a much higher labor productivity and the production of new products, which helped create new jobs, economic growth, and higher incomes”.

### Effects of Increase in Producitivity

#### Americans Work Long Hours

#### Protestant Work Ethic

#### Time vs. Possessions

- we have exchanged leisure time for material possessions. However, our expectations about what we ought to have continues to rise.

### Rise of the Robots❔

- AI - subdiscipline of CS that focuses on developing systems that can perform tasks otherwise requiring human intelligence
- deep learning - developing computer systems that can learn from experience to improve their performance in such challenging problem domains as speech recognition, language translation, and self-driving vehicles
- robotics - an interdisciplinary field of engineering and CS that focuses on the development of autonomous machines that can perform actions otherwise carried out by humans

Roboticist Hans Moravec predicts that by 2050, robots will have replaced human workers not just in manufacturing jobs but in decision-making roles, too. For this reason, Richard Epstein suggests there is an urgent need to discuss ethical issues related to the creation of intelligent robots before they become a reality. Here are some of the questions:

- is it wrong to create machines capable of making human labor obsolete?
- will humans become demoralized by the presence of vastly more intelligent robots? If so, is it wrong to work on the development of such robots?
- Is it morally acceptable to work on the development of an intelligent machine if we cannot be sure that the machine's actions will be benevolent?
- How will we ensure that intelligent robots will not be put to an evil purpose by an malevolent human?
- How will our notions of IP change if computers become capable of creative work?
- How will our ideas bout privacy have to change if legions of superfast computers are analyzing the electronic records of our lives?

personal AI - a machine that is conscious of its own existence.

Is it morally acceptable to attempt the construction of a personal AI?

## 10-3 Workplace Changes

### Organizational

- a typical early use of computers was to automate a back-office function, such as payroll - no changes in organization
- later, companies began using computers inside manufacturing units, enabling them to customize products and provide better service to their customers. This delegated more responsibility to the line workers, and encouraged a decentralization of sales and support functions, reducing a company's bureaucracy
- IT within corporations reached a third stage with the creation of computer networks linking different parts of the business

The overall effect has been to flatten organizational structures.

IT also streamlines organizations by eliminating transactional middlemen. Today, many companies have adopted **supply-chain automation**.

### Telework

an arrangement where employees spend a significant portion of their workday at a distance from the employer of a traditional place of work.

**Advantages:**
- increases productivity
- reduces absenteeism
- improves morale
- a company can recruit and retain more top employees
- saves overhead
- improves the resilience of a company
- good for the environment
- employees may save money

**Disadvantages:**
- threatens the authority and control of managers
- makes it impossible for an employee to have face-to-face interactions with customers at the company site
- sensitive info is less secure
- more difficult to schedule meetings
- teleworkers are less visible
- employees at the office are less likely to contact a teleworker than another person on-site
- teleworkers are isolated
- teleworkers end up working longer hours for the same pay

### Gig Economy

refers to service workers who make a living by completing short-term jobs for clients. These workers don't have a traditional employer, but typically rely upon one or more companies to connect them with clients (Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Airbnb).

Proponents say that it provides workers with independence and flexibility. Critics say that people only take these jobs because they can't find stable employment.

### Monitoring

The principal purpose of monitoring is to identify inappropriate use of company resources. It can also help detect illegal activities of employees, as well as ensure that customers are getting the products and services they need. Companies can also use monitoring to gauge the productivity of their workers.

Companies are using wireless networks to track the locations of their employees. 

More schools are using video cameras to increase security. 

Monitoring is ultimately beneficial to an organization.

### Multinational Teams

- allows a company to have people at work more hours during the day.
- saves costs

- infrastructure in less developed countries can make conducting business more difficult

## 10-4 Globalization

refers to the process of creating a worldwide network of businesses and markets. It results in greater mobility of goods, services, and capital around the world. 

### Arguments for Globalization

- Free trade can increase everyone's standard of living
- People in poorer countries deserve jobs as well
- Every example in the past century of a poor country becoming more prosperous has been the result of that country producing goods for the world market rather than striving for self-sufficiency
- Creating jobs around the world reduces unrest and leads to more stability

### Arguments Against Globalization

- Governments shouldn't be subordinate to the WTO
- Local workers shouldn't be forced to compete with foreign workers who don't receive decent pay and working conditions
- Globalization has accelerated the loss of both manufacturing jobs and white-collar jobs overseas
- The removal of trade barriers hurts worker in foreign countries too

### Dot-Com Bust Increased IT Sector Unemployment

### Foreign Workers in the American IT Industry

### Foreign Competition

## 10-5 The Digital Divide

refers to the situation win which some people have access to modern information technology while other don't. The **global divide** refers to the disparity in Internet access between more industrialized and less industrialized nations. The **social divide** refers to the difference in access between rich and poor within a particular country

### Global Divide

![[Pasted image 20240624200507.png]]

What is hampering Internet development in less technologically developed countries?
- often there is little wealth
- many of these countries have an inadequate telecommunications infrastructure
- the primary language isn't English
- literacy is low and education is inadequate
- the country's culture may not make participating in the Information Age a priority

### Social Divide

### Models of Technological Diffusion

Technological diffusion refers to the rate at which a new technology is assimilated into a society. Two different theories predict how a new technology is acquired by people in a society based on their socioeconomic status:

![[Pasted image 20240624200742.png]]

### Critiques of the Digital Divide

- it tends to promote the idea that the difference between the "haves" and the "have-nots" is simply a question of access: for IT to make a difference, social systems must change as well.
- it implies everyone is on one side or another of a huge canyon
- it implies that a lack of access will lead to a less advantaged position in society, which may not be a proper causality

### Massive Open Online Courses

Free MOOCs are often promoted as a way to make higher education more affordable. However, there are studies that provide evidence that a shift toward online education could exacerbate differences in success rates that already exist between different subgroups of students.

### Net Neutrality

Corporations that operate the long-distance Internet backbone connections suggested that they might begin **tiered service**—charging more for higher-priority routing of Internet packets.

Content providers such as Google and Yahoo joined forces with the American Library Association and consumer groups to oppose any notion of tiered service. These groups asked Congress to enact "net neutrality" legislation that would require ISPs to treat all packets the same. 

## 10-6 The "Winner-Take-All" Society

Many people believe that a market economy that rewards innovation, hard work, and risk taking by compensating people according to the value of the goods they produce is better than an economy where everyone is paid the same.

Economists Robert Frank and Philip Cook explore the growth of markets in which a few top performers receive a disproportionate share of the rewards. Currently, the winner-take-all phenomenon has spread throughout our global economy. Sometimes, the qualitative difference between the top product and the second-best product is very slight, yet that can be the difference between success and failure. 

Several factors have influenced this:
- IT and efficient transportation systems make it easier for a leading product to dominate the worldwide market
- network economies encourage people to flock to the same product 
- English has become the de facto language of international business
- Business norms have changed

### Harmful Effects

- increase the gap between the rich and the poor
- draw some of the most talented people into socially unproductive work
- create wasteful investment and consumption—prisoner's dilemma
- disproportionate share of the best and brightest college students become concentrated in a few elite institutions
- gives much greater rewards to the top performers than those whose performance is only slightly inferior

They also harm our culture
- sales and name over talent

### Reducing Winner-Take-All Effects

- societies can enact laws limiting the number of hours that stores remain open for business, ensuring parity among competing businesses and preventing them from engaging in positional arms races
- in the absence of laws, businesses can form cooperative agreements to reduce positional arms races
- more progressive tax structures reduce excess competition for the few handsomely rewarded positions
- campaign finance reform can reduce the political power of the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, who control more than one-third of the wealth
