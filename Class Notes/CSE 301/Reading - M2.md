## 1-1 Introduction

Two principal catalysts for the Information Age:
- low-cost computers
- high-speed communication networks

*Lots of new tech*.

- New technology can change humans physically through indirect means whether good or bad (think of London taxi example - hippocampi growth)
- New technology can change humans mentally through indirect means (think cell phone and dependency + dopamine)

>[!note] Amish
>The Amish adopt technology that 'bring people together' and reject technology that 'draw people apart'. Think gas barbecue vs. telephone.

- New technologies both solve and create problems (think cars - transportation vs. congestion, Internet - communication vs. exposure)
- We cannot prevent a new technology from being invented, but we can control whether we adopt it or not.
- The rate at which new technologies are developed can be influenced (regulations/laws)

## 1-2 Milestones in Computing

### Aids to Manual Calculating

- Erasable clay, wax tablets, erasable slates, paper tablets

>[!info] abacus
>a computing aid in which a person performs arithmetic operations by sliding counters along rods, wires, or lines. 
>
>*P.S.* the word "counter" came to mean not only the disk being manipulated but also the place in a store where transactions take place.

- Mathematical tables: think reference manuals

### Mechanical Calculators

- Pascal's calculator (1640)
- Leibniz's 'Step Reckoner' 
- Charles Thomas de Colmar's *Arithmometer* - the first commercially successful calculator
- Georg and Edvard Scheutz's difference engine - the world's first printing calculator that typesetted the values onto molds

America in the late 1800s - the "Gilded Age", characterized by rapid industrialization, economic expansion, and a concentration of corporate power.

- The Burroughs Adding Machine Company in the 1890s, William Burroughs

>[!note]
>The adoption of mechanical calculators led to the "de-skilling" and "feminization" of bookkeeping; calculators leveled the bookkeeping playing field, making people of average ability quite productive. As managers introduced them into offices, male bookkeepers were replaced with female bookkeepers and lowered wages.

### Cash Register

- Ohio restauranteur James Ritty (1878)

### Punched-Card Tabulation

- Herman Hollerith - punched cards for storing data, could be sorted into groups
- **Data-processing systems:** receive input data, perform calculations, and produce output data.
	- Used in the Holocaust

### Precursors of Commercial Computers

- Iowa State College professor John Atanasoff and grad student Clifford Berry's Atanasoff-Berry Computer - used to solve systems of linear equations, not reprogrammable.
- Dr. John W. Mauchly, physics professor at University of Pennsylvania, worked with J. Presper Eckert to create the ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer) in 1946 for ballistics calculations for the US Army. 2400 times faster than a person with a desk calculator.
- EDVAC (electronic discrete variable automatic computer), successor to the ENIAC, could store program in primary memory along with data manipulated by the program.
- British engineer F. C. Williams, with a team at the University of Manchester, created the Williams Tube (a CRT storage device) and the Small-Scale Experimental Machine in 1948 - the first operational, fully electronic computer system that had both program and data stored in its memory.

### First Commercial Computers

- Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer in 1951.
- UNIVAC in 1946 (universal automatic computer), Remington Rand bought out the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation and delivered it to the US Bureau of the Census in 1951. Very popular until IBM took over.
- IBM dominated the computer industry in the mid-1960s

### Programming Languages and Time-Sharing

- Frances Holberton, Grace Murray Hopper - create ways to generate machine programs from a higher level than assembly
- John Backus led the effort to develop FORTRAN in 1957. Became an international standard.
- In 1959, the US Department of Defense brought together a committee to create COBOL, a business-oriented programming language. Made as a 'universal common' programming language.
- Early 1960s, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth directed teams of undergraduates to develop the DTSS (Dartmouth Time-Sharing System) that gave multiple users the ability to edit and run their programs simultaneously. BASIC as a simple, easy-to-learn programming language.

### Transistor and Integrated Circuit

- WWII radar systems required higher-frequency receivers utilizing semiconductors, so semiconductor manufacturing ability was greatly increased.
- 1948, Bell Labs announced the invention of the transistor
- Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments are credited for independently inventing the integrated circuit.
- 1960s Cold War used ICs in the Minuteman II program (ballistic missiles). Gordon Moore's 1965 Moore's Law (double transistors)

### IBM System/360

- In 1964 IBM unveiled the System/360, a series of 19 compatible computers with varying levels of computing speed and memory capacity.

### Microprocessor

- 1968 Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore leave Fairchild Semiconductor to create Intel
- 1969, Ted Hoff, Stanley Mazor, and Federico Faggin release the Intel 4004, world's first microprocessor, same power as the ENIAC with 1/8 inch by 1/6 inch dimensions.
- Made it possible to integrate computers into everyday devices

### Personal Computer

>The People’s Computer Company was a not-for-profit corporation dedicated to educating people on how to use computers. One of its activities was publishing a newspaper. The cover of the first issue read: “Computers are mostly used against people instead of for people, used to control people instead of to free them, time to change all that—we need a PEOPLE’S COMPUTER COMPANY”.

- Altair 8800 created by MITS
- Micro-Soft - Paul Allen and Bill Gates with their Altair 8800 and BASIC interpreter 
- Apple Computer created by Steve Wozniak (Hewlett-Packard) and Jobs, launched Apple Computer
- Computer spreadsheet program, fall of 1979 - VisiCalc.
- Release of the IBM PC in 1981 - reputable
- 1980, Microsoft creates DOS for IBM PC.

## 1-3 Milestones in Networking

### ARPANET

- In reaction to Sputnik in 1957, Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created by the Department of Defense.

>[!info] circuit-switched network
>a single physical connection is established between the two ends. The physical connection cannot be shared.

![[Pasted image 20240520212540.png]]

>[!info] packet-switched network
>a message is divided into small bundles of data called packets. Every packet has the address of the computer where it should be routed. If there is more than one path from the message source to the message destination, different message packets may take different routes. Packets from different message may share the same wire.

### Email

- March 1972, Ray Tomlinson wrote the first software enabling email messages to be sent and received by ARPANET computers.

### Internet

- Robert Kahn developed the concept of 'open architecture networking', in which individual networks could be quite different as long as they shared a common "internetworking architecture". 
- Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn designed the TCP/IP protocol that would support open architecture networking. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for dividing a message into packets at the sending computer and reassembling the packets at the receiving computer. IP (Internet Protocol) is the set of rules used to route data from computer to computer. The ***Internet*** is the network of networks that communicate using TCP/IP.  January 1, 1983, the birth date of the internet.

### NSFNET

- National Science Foundation (NSF) saw the importance of networking to the academic community

### Broadband

- **Broadband:** a high-speed Internet connection.

### Wireless Networks

- First cell phone demonstrated by Motorola in 1973.
- 1993, Henrik Sjödin proposed the development of public-access wireless local area networks. Today, wireless Internet access points (hotspots) are commonplace. Most hotspots use a technology known as Wi-Fi.

### Cloud Computing

the utilization of remote computing resources over the Internet; the term comes from the tradition of representing networks as clouds in technical diagrams.

enablers of cloud computing:
- high-speed networks
- high-performance, low-cost microprocessors
- low-cost storage
- virtualization - software that enables a single physical computer to emulate many virtual computing devices

## 1-4 Milestones in Information Storage and Retrieval

### Hypertext

- 1965, Ted Nelson coined the word **hypertext**, which refers to a linked network of nodes containing information, allowing readers to visit the nodes in a nonlinear fashion.

### GUI

- Douglas Engelbart "the mother of all demos" at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference with NLS and graphical user interfaces.
- 1970, Alan Kay and Xerox Palo Alto Research Center created the Alto. Also created Ethernet to link together the Alto.
- 1984, after visiting Xerox PARC to learn about GUI, Apple released the Macintosh
- Windows 3.0 in May 1990

### Single-Computer Hypertext Systems

- 1982 Peter Brown at University of Kent at Canterbury started a hypertext research project. 
- 1987 Apple computer released HyperCard - "stacks" of "cards", each containing text and images, link cards to other cards.

### Networked Hypertext - World Wide Web

- Tim Berners-Lee created a hypertext system that allowed Links between information stored on *different* computers connected by a network

>[!info] Web browser
>A program that allows a user to view Web pages and traverse hyperlinks between pages.

- Berners-Lee completed the first Web browser on Christmas Day 1990. He called his browser WorldWideWeb.

### Search Engines

>[!info] search engine
>A program that accepts a list of keywords from a user, searches a database of documents, and returns those documents most closely matching the specified keywords.

### Cloud Storage

>[!info] cloud storage
>Refers to a model of storing data remotely on servers accessed through the Internet, in contrast to storing data locally on a computer's own hard drive or other mass storage device.

## 1-5 Contemporary Information Technology Issues

>[!note] Information technology (IT)
>Refers to devices used in the creation, storage, manipulation, exchange, and dissemination of data, including text, sound, and images.

- Intellectual property rights are needed, but how much is the question? Also laws and business adaptation.
- Cloud storage safety and reliability concerns
- Credit card privacy and theft concerns
- pros and cons of data-driven decision-making
- Liability of software-related accidents
- Effects on the workplace (monitoring, logging)
- Telecommuting
- Software jobs and tech trends
- Outsourcing tech production - unsafe or jobless?
- Democracy or fake freedom?

## Summary

- Revolutionary discoveries are rare.
- The impact of IT on society did not begin with the PC and the World Wide Web. Many other inventions (telegraph, telephone, calculator, radio, TV) were also factors.
- The rapid rate of tech change is causing a number of important new questions to emerge that test our values.

>The question is not "What will the computer do to us?" The question is "What will we make of the computer?" The point is not to predict the computer future. The point is to make it.
- Seymour Papert
