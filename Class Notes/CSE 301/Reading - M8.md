## 5-1 Introduction

- Is it possible to maintain privacy in the Information Age?
- What is privacy?
- Do we have a natural right to privacy?
- What about our need to understand other people to trust them?
- How do we handle conflicts between the right to privacy and the right to free expression?

## 5-2 Perspectives on Privacy

### Defining Privacy

- Discussions about privacy revolve around the notion of ***access***, where it means either physical proximity to a person or knowledge about that person.
- There is a tug-of-war between the desires/rights/responsibilities of a person who wants to restrict access to himself of outsiders who want to gain access.
	- From the person who wants to restrict access, privacy is a "zone of inaccessibility" - you have privacy to the extent that you can control who is allowed into your zone of inaccessibility. Note that privacy is not the same thing as being alone.
	- From the outsiders seeking access, the discussion revolves around where to draw the line between what is private and what is public. 
- Society can be harmed if individuals have too much privacy. (withholding opportunities, social/economic inequities, or withholding key decision-making information for the public good)

>[!important] Summary
>Privacy is a social arrangement that allows individuals to have some level of control over who is able to gain access to their physical selves and their personal information.

### Harms and Benefits of Privacy

**Harms:**
- Some people take advantage of privacy to plan and carry out illegal/immoral activities. Most wrongdoing takes place under the cover of privacy.
- Increasing privacy has caused unhappiness by putting too great a burden on the nuclear family to care for all of its members.
- Privacy lets dysfunctional families fly under the radar.
- For people desiring social engagement, an abundance of privacy may be a curse, not a blessing.

**Benefits:**
- Privacy is necessary for a person to blossom as an individual - it is the way in which a social group recognizes and communicates to the individual that he is responsible for his development as a unique person, a separate moral agent. Privacy is a recognition of each person's true freedom.
- It lets us be ourselves.
- It lets us remove our public persona, helpful for psychological wellbeing.
- Privacy can foster intellectual activities
- Some maintain that privacy is the only way in which people can develop relationships involving respect, love friendship, and trust. Think of privacy as "moral capital" that people use to build intimate relationships.
- In order to have different kinds of social relationships with different people, we need to have some kind of control over who knows what about us.
	- Intimacy is not just about sharing information; it's also about caring; thus, others are critical of suggestions that tie intimacy too closely to sharing information.

### Is There a Natural Right to Privacy❔

#### Privacy Rights Evolve from Property Rights

Historically, Europeans have viewed the home as a sanctuary. The English common-law tradition has been that "a man's home is his castle."

>[!note] Third Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
>No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

From this viewpoint, privacy is seen in terms of control over personal territory, and privacy rights evolve out of property rights.

#### Warren and Brandeis - Clearly, People have a right to Privacy

They argue that there are no adequate legal remedies available to the victims of privacy breaches. Laws against libel and slander aren't sufficient because they don't address the situation where malicious but true stories about someone are circulated.

They pointed out that the right to privacy had already been recognized by French law. Though it took decades, the right to privacy is now recognized in American courts.

#### Thomson - Every "Privacy Right" Violation is a Violation of Another Right

Whenever the right to privacy is violated, another right is violated as well. There is a cluster of rights associated w/ privacy, just as there is a cluster of rights associated w/ property and a cluster of rights associated w/ our physical selves. Since this is the case, there is no need to define privacy precisely or to decide exactly where to draw the line between violations of privacy and acceptable conduct.

#### Autonomous Moral Agents Need Some Privacy

Many think that privacy principles should be based on the more fundamental principle that each person is worthy of respect. We give each other privacy because we recognize privacy is needed if people are to be autonomous moral agents able to develop healthy personal relationships and act as free citizens in a democratic society.

#### Conclusion

Most philosophers disagree whether there is a natural right to privacy, but most commentators can agree that it is a **prudential right**, which means that rational agents would agree to recognize some privacy rights because it would be a benefit of society.

### Privacy and Trust

The consequence of modern privacy is that we live among strangers. Yet when we live in a society with others, we must be able to trust them to some extent. 

In order to trust others, we must rely on their reputations. Today society must get information out of people to establish reputations. One way of getting information from a person is through an **ordeal**, such as a lie detector test or a drug test. The other way to learn more about individuals is to issue (and request) **credentials**.

## 5-3 Information Disclosure

### Public Records

contains info about an incident or action reported to a government agency for the purpose of informint the public.

Computerized databases and the Internet have made accessing many public records quick and inexpensive, and there are a lot of good purposes to which we can put all that info.

Other uses may not be as laudable; thanks to IT, it's easier than ever to learn a lot about someone's wealth.

### Information Held by Private Organizations

People often voluntarily or involuntarily disclose information to private organizations.

Recall the perspective that privacy is a "zone of inaccessibility". In some settings, we expect to have much more control over our personal info that in other venues. Hence, our expectations about the privacy of our personal info depends on the situation. 

### Facebook Tabs

a label identify a person in a photo. When you post a photo to Facebook, you can tag the people in the photo who are on your list of Facebook friends.

Concerns about using facial recognition software in regards to consent.

### Enhanced 911 Services

All cell phone provides in the U.S. are required by law to be able to track the locations of active cell phone users to within 100 meters. The safety benefit of this capability is obvious.

It also has other benefits. For example, it makes it easier for cell phone companies to identify where signal strength is weak and coverage needs to be improved. 

The downside is a potential loss of privacy. Because it is possible to track the location of active cell phone users, what happens if the info is sold or shared?

### Rewards or Loyalty Programs

Companies can use info about buying habits to provide individualized service.

Critics say that the problem is not that card users pay less for their groceries but that those who don't use cards pay more. 

Some consumers respond to the potential loss of privacy by giving phony personal info when they apply for those cards.

### Body Scanners

In some stores, you can be scanned by a computer, which produces a 3D model of your body. The computer uses this info to recommend which pairs of jeans ought to fit you the best.

### RFID Tags

RFIDs instead of barcodes. Though more convenient, it would make it easier to associate products with individuals and thus diminish their privacy.

### Implanted Chips

### Mobile Apps

They collect info even when it isn't being used for your own purposes.

### Facebook Login

gives permission to app developers to use your Facebook info.

### OnStar

Communication system on an automobile, could be abused.

### Automobile Black Boxes

### Medical Records

Once an individual's entire medical history is consolidated in a database accessible by many, it can be more difficult to control how that information is disseminated, with potentially significant consequences (Job Employment, discrimination).

### Digital Video Recorders

### Cookies

a file placed on your computer's hard drive by a Web server. It contains info about your visits to a Web site.

In May 2018, the GDPR requires that companies disclose the info they are seeking to collect and why they are collecting it, and get permission before gathering the info.

## 5-4 Data Mining

### Definition

**data mining** is the process of searching through many records in one or more databases looking for patterns or relationships. Data mining is a way to generate new information by combining facts found in multiple transactions.

#### Collaborative Filtering

algorithms that draw upon info about the preferences of a large number of people to predict what an individual may enjoy.

### Opt-In vs Opt-Out

- Opt-In: requires the consumer to explicitly give permission for the organization to share the information with another organization.
- Opt-Out: requires the consumer to explicitly forbid an organization from sharing information with other organizations

![[Pasted image 20240606174623.png]]

Data mining can be surprisingly powerful.

### Example of Data Mining

#### Targeting Pregnant Women

Target.

#### Credit Reports

Credit bureau (company that keeps track of an individual's assets, debts, and history of paying bills and repaying loans, using this info to determine the creditworthiness of that person) uses data mining and sells your record to others

#### Targeted Direct Mail and Data Brokers

**data brokers:** companies that combine info gathered online with offline info, such as magazine subscriptions, loyalty cards, and government records, to create comprehensive profiles of consumers.

#### Microtargeting

a technique where a campaign combines data about voter registration, voting frequency, and contributions with consumer data and information available from a geographic information system to gain insights into which candidate the voter is likely to favor.

### Social Network Analysis

A relatively new area in data mining is the incorporation of information collected from social networks. 

Employers, banks, cell phone markets, police, everyone uses it to make decisions.

### Release of 'Anonymized' Datasets

#### Netflix Prize

#### AOL Search Dataset

## 5-5 Example of Consumer or Political Backlash

### Marketplace - Households

Lotus Development Corporation + Equifax developed a database on 120 million people that would allow users to produce direct-mailing lists based on various criteria. Huge backlash.

Now Acxiom and Experian are doing the same in a much more detailed manner.

### Facebook Beacon

Opt-Out advertising service.

### Malls Track Shoppers' Cell Phones

For data, to "create a level playing field for offline retailers"

### iPhone Apps Uploading Address Books

### Instagram's Proposed Change to ToS

Business entities use your photos without your consent and without compensation

### Cambridge Analytica

2016 Political campaign 'data broker' supported by Facebook Login that was supposedly for academic purposes

## Summary

Privacy can be seen as a balancing
act among the desires of the individual, the profit motive of companies, and the common
good. The individual seeks to restrict access to personal information. Companies seek to
gather information and sell it to those who want access to it. The common good dictates
that some information should be widely known. Society must decide which information
ought to be private, which information can be gathered and sold, and which information
should be public.
