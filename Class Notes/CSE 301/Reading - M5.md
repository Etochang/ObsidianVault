# Reading - M5

>Chapter 3

## 3-1 Introduction

The development of these networks has provided us with exciting new ways to conduct business, connect with friends, and entertain ourselves.

However, other results are less positive: new ways of scamming, bullying, and harassing others, and new concerns about the impact of social media on democratic institutions.

## 3-2 Spam

>[!info] spam
>Unsolicited bulk email.

Why is spam called spam? 

Brad Templeton, chairman of the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, traces the term back to the SPAM sketch from *The Final Rip Off* by Monty Python’s Flying Circus, in which a group of Vikings drown out a café conversation by loudly
and obnoxiously repeating the word “spam”. In a similar way, legitimate email messages can get “drowned out” by spam.

### The Spam Tsunami

transformation of Internet from noncommercial academic/research to commercial global network --> Rise of spam

- Spam was not seen as much of a problem throughout the 1990s, and even in the year 2002 it accounted for only about 9 percent of all email traffic.
- 2003, a big jump in spam messages, and by 2009, about 85 percent of all email was spam. It consumed a large percentage of the Internet's bandwidth and huge amounts of storage space on mail servers/individual computers
- Spam filters were installed (looked for large number of messages/sus subject lines/spamlike content), tens of billions of dollars per year lost in wasted productivity
- Effective because low cost
- millions of addresses (email lists) can be harvested and sold to spammers through viruses/dictionary attacks, fine print (TOS)
- **botnets:** huge networks of compromised computers controlled by "bot herders", used to send out spam
- In 2017, spam accounted for about 57% of email messages

### Need for Social-Technical Solutions

- The spam problem happened because Internet/email tech developed w/o taking social expectations into account. 
- In order to be fair, communications should be two-way, not one-way.

## 3-3 Internet Interactions

### The World Wide Web

- Two attributes enabled the Web to become a global tool for information exchange:
	1. It is decentralized: an individual/organization can add new information to the web without asking for permission from a central authority.
	2. Every object on the Web has a unique address. Any object can link to any other object by referencing its address (also called a URL)

### Mobile Apps

Software programs that are loaded onto mobile devices.

### How We Use the Internet

1. We buy.
2. We sell.
3. We socialize.
4. We contribute content. (wiki)
5. We blog. (short for Web log)
6. We visit secret Web sites. (darknet - a network of Web sites that can only be accessed through special software that encrypts messages and provides users with anonymity)
7. We engage in crowdsourcing (an online method of getting goods/services from a large group of people)
8. We learn.
9. We explore our roots
10. We enter virtual worlds
11. We control the Internet of Things
12. We pay our taxes

- Echo chambers, instead of people consciously choosing things to see things they believe, the algorithm feeds it to them instead.

### Troubling Times for Traditional Newspapers

- rapid growth in advertising through social media and the popularity of Craigslist have weakened the financial health of traditional print newspapers.
- The power of the press, the Fourth Estate, in terms of holding accountably and ensuring informed citizenry

## 3-6 Censorship

The attempt to suppress or regulate public access to material considered offensive or harmful. Mostly has been exercised by governments and religious institutions.

### Direct Censorship

Three forms:
1. Government monopolization
2. Prepublication review
3. Licensing and registration

The first form:
	The government owns all forms of media dissemination
The second form:
	The government restricts the publication of information that is harmful
The third form:
	The government issues licenses to publish information (limited bandwidth)

### Self-Censorship

After Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled in April 2003, CNN chief news executive Eason Jordan admitted that CNN had suppressed negative info about the Iraqi government for a while to protect their operations and employees in Iraq

- maintain good relations with government officials.
- ratings systems

### Challenges Posed by the Internet Regarding Censorship

1. Unlike traditional one-to-many broadcast media, the Internet supports many-to-many communications.
2. The Internet is dynamic
3. The Internet is huge
4. The Internet is global
5. It is hard to distinguish between children and adults on the Internet

### Government Filtering and Surveillance of Internet Content

- make the Internet virtually inaccessible - North Korea
- Internet is carefully controlled - Saudi Arabia, China
- Limiting but not forbidding - Western nations

### Kant's Views on Censorship

The Enlightenment (Kant came from this) was a reaction to the institutional control over thought held by the aristocracy and the Church. The obstacles preventing people from exercising their own reason were being removed - he opposed censorship as a backward step to this removal.

### Mill's Views on Censorship

Four reasons for freedom of opinion and freedom of expression of opinion

1. None of us are infallible, and all of us are capable of error. If we prevent someone from voicing their opinion, we may actually be silencing the voice of truth.
2. While opinions that are expressed may be erroneous, it may yet contain a kernel of truth. In general, the majority opinion is not the whole truth.
3. Even if the majority opinion should happen to be the whole truth, it is in the clash of ideas that this truth is rationally tested and validated. The whole truth left untested is simply a prejudice.
4. An opinion that has been test in the fire of a free and open discourse is more likely to have a "vital effect on the character and conduct."

### Mill's Principle of Harm

- A lack of government censorship can also lead to harm. Under what circumstances should the government intervene?

>[!info] Principle of Harm
>The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.

## 3-7 Freedom of Expression

### History

- American Revolution - criticism of government was seen as a threat to public order
- Restriction on freedom of speech in England date back to 1275 - De Scandalis Magnatum
- May 1787, delegates from the thirteen states gathered to revise the Articles of Confederation
- During the first Congress, James Madison proposed 12 amendments to the constitution (human rights)
- 10 were quickly ratified, called the Bill of Rights.
- The first was guaranteeing freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

>[!info] First Amendment
>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.


### Freedom of Expression - Not an Absolute Right

The primary purpose of the First Amendment's free speech guarantee is political - it allows an open discussion of public issues.

However, this right to free expression is not limited to political speech. It also promotes scientific and artistic expression. Protected "speech" includes art and certain kinds of conduct, such as burning an American flag.

US Supreme Court: freedom of expression isn't an absolute right. Those who abuse this freedom and harm the public may be punished. For example, protection is not given to "libel, reckless or calculated lies, slander, misrepresentation, perjury, false advertising, obscenity and profanity, solicitation of crime, and personal abuse or 'fighting' words," because these actions do not serve the ends of the First Amendment.

Also some restrictions are justified because of the greater public good that results.

### *FCC v. Pacifica Foundation*

Reasons why broadcasters have less protection than booksellers or theater owners:
1. Broadcast media have a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans. Prior warnings cannot completely protect people from being exposed to offensive material
2. Broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read.

## 3-8 Children and Inappropriate Content

### Web Filters

A piece of software that prevents certain Web pages from being displayed by your browser.

Typical filters use 2 different methods to determine if a page should be blocked. The first method is to check the URL of the page against a blacklist of objectionable sites. The second method is to look for combinations of letters/words that may indicate a site has objectionable content.

### Child Internet Protection Act

- March 2003, the Supreme Court in the case of *United States v. American Library Association*.  Can the government require libraries to install antipornography filters in return for receiving federal funds for Internet access.
- CIPA requires that libraries receiving federal funds to provide Internet access to its patrons must prevent children from getting access to visual depictions of obscenity and child pornography. The law allows adults who desire access to a blocked page to ask a librarian to remove the filter.
