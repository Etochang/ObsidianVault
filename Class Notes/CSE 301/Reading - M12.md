## 9-1 Introduction

Informally, a **profession** is a vocation that requires a high level of education and practical experience in the field. Professionals have a special obligation to ensure their actions are for the good of those who depend on them, because their decisions can have more serious consequences than the choices made by those holding less responsible positions in society.

## 9-2 How Well Developed Are the Computing Professions‚ùî

### Characteristics of a Fully Developer Profession

- **Initial Professional Education:** formal coursework completed by candidates before they begin practicing the profession
- **Accreditation:** a means of assuring that the formal coursework meets the standards of the profession
- **Skills Development:** activities that provide candidates with the opportunity to gain practical skills needed to practice the profession
- **Certification:** a process by which candidates are evaluated to determine their readiness to enter the profession
- **Licensing:** the process giving candidates the legal right to practice the profession
- **Professional Development:** formal coursework completed by professionals in order to maintain and develop their knowledge and skills
- **Code of Ethics:** a mechanism by which a profession ensures that its members use their knowledge and skills for the benefit of society
- **Professional Society:** an organization promoting the welfare of the profession, typically consisting of most, if not all, members of the profession

When the public can trust the members of a profession, every one of its members benefits. 

### How Do Computer-Related Careers Stack Up to Others?

People may write computer programs and maintain computer systems w/o being certified or having been granted a license, in contrast to careers like lawyers/physicians.

A person doesn't have to complete college or serve an apprenticeship under the guidance of an experienced mentor in order to gain employment as a programmer, system administrator, or systems analyst. 

The vast majority of people who hold computer-related jobs don't belong to either of computing's professional societies.

Typically, professionals work directly with individual clients, while most computer programmers work inside a company as a part of a team that includes many other programmers as well as managers.

#### Status of Certification and Licensing

A **software engineer** is someone engaged in the development or maintenance of software, or someone who teaches in this area.

Currently, there is no certification/licensing that is nationally accepted.

#### Ability to Harm the Public

The computing "profession" may not be as well-developed as the medical or legal professions, but in one key respect - the ability to harm members of the public - those who design, implement, and maintain computer hardware/software systems sometimes hold responsibilities similar to those held by members of mature professions.

## 9-3 Software Engineering Code of Ethics

### Preamble

Computers have a central role in today's society. Software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm, or to influence others to do good or cause harm. As such, software engineers must commit themselves to making the profession beneficial and respected. 

### Principles

#### Public

Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest:

- accept full responsibility for their own work
- moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and the users with the public good
- approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and doesn't diminish quality of life, privacy, or harm the environment. 
- Disclose to appropriate persons any actual/potential danger
- Cooperate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern
- Be fair and avoid deception in all statements
- Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources, economic disadvantage, etc
- Be encouraged to volunteer skills to good causes

#### Client and Employer

Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer, consistent with the public interest.

- provide service in their areas of competence while being honest about their limitations
- not knowingly use software that is obtained illegally/unethically
- use the property of a client/employer only in ways properly authorized
- ensure that any document upon which they rely has been approved

- identify, define and address ethical, economic, cultural, legal and environmental issues
- ensure that they are qualified
- ensure an appropriate method is used for any project
- work to follow professional standards
- strive to fully understand the specifications for software on which they work
- ensure specifications have been well documented, satisfy requirements and have approvals
- ensure realistic quantitative estimates
- ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review
- ensure adequate documentation
- work to develop software that respects privacy
- be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means
- maintain the integrity of data
- treat all forms of software maintenance with the same professionalism as new development

#### Judgment

Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgement:

- temper all technical judgements to support/maintain human values
- only endorse documents either prepared under their supervision or within their areas of competence
- maintain professional objectivity
- not engage in deceptive financial practices
- disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped
- refuse to participate in a private, governmental or professional body concerned with software related issues in which their employers/clients have undisclosed potential conflicts of interest

#### Management

Software engineering managers/leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance:

- ensure good management for any project
- ensure that software engineers are informed of standards
