>4.1-4.4

## 4-1 Introduction

We discuss:
- How IT is affecting our notions of intellectual property
- Consider what makes intellectual property different from tangible property and how governments have created a variety of mechanisms to guarantee intellectual property rights
- Examine what has been considered "fair use" of intellectual property created by others
- How new copy protection tech is eroding the notions of fair use
- Explore P2P networks
- Explore the evolution of intellectual property protection for software
- Explore the open-source movement

## 4-2 Intellectual Property Rights

refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce - *World Intellectual Property Organization*

### Property Rights

- John Locke (1632-1704)
- *The Second Treatise of Government* - Locke makes the following case for a natural right to property:
	- First, people have a right to property in their own person. Nobody has a right to the person of anybody else.
	- Second, people have a right to their own labor. The work that people perform should be to their own benefit.
	- Third, people have a right to those things that they have removed from Nature through their own labor.

This definition of property makes sense as long as:
- no person claims more property than he or she can use.
- when people remove something from the common state in order to make it their own property, there is still plenty left over for others to claim through their labor.

*useful at explaining how virtually unlimited resources are initially appropriated. not useful when there are limited resources*

### Extending to Intellectual Property

- Michael Scanlan's 2 scenarios illustrating the problem with extending Locke's natural-rights argument to intellectual property:
	- two people laboring independently and producing the same thing - doesn't work because 2 instances of intellectual property cannot be distinct in the same way 2 instances of physical property can be. The **uniqueness**.
	- When someone steals a piece of physical property, the owner cannot utilize anymore; not the same for intellectual property. So is it stealing? and if it isn't, then is it property?

Two important differences:
- Every intellectual property is unique.
- Copying is different for the kinds of property

### Benefits of IP protection

- Encourages creativity since inventors will have financial incentive

### Limits to IP protection

- Society benefits the most when inventions are in the public domain.
- Compromise: inventors/authors only have exclusive rights for a limited period of time.

## 4-3 Protecting IP

### Trade Secrets

A confidential piece of IP that provides a company with a competitive advantage: processes, formulas, proprietary designs, strategic plans, customer lists, and other collections of info.

Advantage:
- they do not expire; a company never has to disclose a trade secret

The value of trade secrets is in their confidentiality. Hence they aren't an appropriate way to protect many forms of IP. 

While it is illegal to steal a trade secret, there are other ways in which confidentiality may be broken. Reverse engineering, hiring from competitors, etc.

### Trademarks and Service Marks

A word, symbol, picture, sound, or color used by a business to identify goods; a mark identifying a service.

A government grants a trademark, giving a company the right to use it and the right to prevent other companies from using it. Thus enabling "brand names."

Advantages:
- branding allows consumers to have more confidence in product/service quality.

>When a company is the first to market a distinctive product, it runs the risk that its brand name will become a common noun used to describe any similar product. When this happens, the company may lose its right to exclusive use of the brand name. Some trademarks that have become common nouns are yo-yo, aspirin, escalator, thermos, and brassiere.

### Patents

how the US gov. provides IP protection for a limited time to creators of machines, systems, and other inventions. Different from a trade secret because a patent is a public document that provides a detailed description of the invention. The owner of the patent can prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention for the lifetime of the patent, which is currently 20 years.

### Copyrights

how the US gov. provides authors with certain rights to original works that they have written:

1. The right to reproduce the copyrighted work
2. The right to distribute copies of the work to the public
3. The right to display copies of the work in public
4. The right to perform the work in public
5. The right to produce new works derived from the copyrighted work

## 4-4 Fair Use

Under some circumstances, it is legal to reproduce a copyrighted work without the permission of the copyright holder.

Four factors that need to be considered: Section 107 of the Copyright Act:
1. What is the purpose and character of the use?
	- The most important consideration is the extent to which the author has transformed the original copyrighted work.
2. What is the nature of the work being copied?
	- nonfiction is more permissible than fiction, published works are preferred over unpublished works
3. How much of the copyrighted work is being used?
4. How will this use affect the market for the copyrighted work?
