## 9-6 Whistle-Blowing

**whistle-blower:** someone who breaks ranks with an organization in order to make an unauthorized disclosure of info about a harmful situation after attempts to report the concerns through authorized organizational channels have been ignored or rebuffed.

### Morton Thiokol/NASA

- January 28, 1986, *Challenger* lifts off from Cape  Canaveral - 73 seconds after liftoff, hot gases leaking from one of the booster rockets led to an explosion that destroyed the *Challenger* and killed everyone on board
- Engineer Roger Boisjoly was in charge of inspecting booster O-rings, and he had seen evidence that a primary O-ring seal had failed on two occasions in 1985
- January 27. 1986, Boisjoly and a group of Morton Thiokol engineers met to discuss the proposed launch for the following day. Florida was in the middle of an unusual cold snap, and the engineers knew that that would increase the probability that an O-ring would fail. They prepared a set of 14 slides that documented their concern about a low-temperature launch
- That evening, they had a teleconference with the Marshall Space Flight Center; the presentation ended with the engineers' recommendation that NASA not launch the *Challenger* if the temperature was below 53 degrees. NASA asked Morton Thiokol VP Joe Kilminster for his opinion, and he recommended to not launch
- NASA officials were displeased, as the launch had already been delayed several times. After NASA officials expressed their dismay with the recommendation, Kilminster took a break to discuss with the other VPs, and eventually came to the conclusion to recommend the launch
- A month after the failure, Boisjoly testified before a presidential commission appointed to investigate the failure. Boisjoly shared everything, and the compony responded by isolating Boisjoly from NASA personnel and the O-ring redesign effort

### Hughes Aircraft

- 1980s, Hughes Aircraft manufactured military-grade hybrid computer chips. The military put these chips in a variety of sophisticated weapons systems, such as fighter planes and air-to-air missiles
- the government insisted that in return for paying high prices, the chips should pass stringent QA tests. There were two kinds of tests - first, they ensured the chips functioned correctly, and second, they checked the chips for resistance to shocks, high temperatures, and moisture. About 10% of the chips failed, one common problem being that a chip would have a defective seal, which let moisture in; these chips were called "leakers"
- August 1986, floor worker Lisa Lightner found a leaker. Supervisor Donald LaRue ordered her to pass the chip. Lightner told other supervisor Margaret Goodearl, who passed the incident to upper management. Hughes Aircraft management threatened to fire Goodearl if she didn't reveal the identity of the worker who had complained
- Two months later, LaRue orders Shirley Reddick, another floor worker, to reseal lids in violation of the required process for handling leakers. Same thing happens again
- Same month, LaRue asks tester Rachel Janesch to certify that a defective chip had passed the leak test. Goodearl reported again, and in this case the chips were retested
- Same thing happens over and over until Goodearl was fired in 1989 and Ibarra had left Hughes Aircraft in 1988. They filed a civil suit against Hughes Aircraft in 1990, and eventually won
- Both were unemployed for an extended period of time, which affected them greatly

### US Legislation Related to Whistle-Blowing

- Whistle-blowers are usually punished for disclosing info that organizations have tried to keep under wraps. If they don't lose their jobs outright, they have probably lost all chances for future advancement within the organization. Whistle-blowers and their families typically suffer emotional distress and economic hardship
- Nevertheless, they often serve the public good. For this reason, the US government has passed two pieces of legislation to encourage whistle-blowing - the False Claims Act and the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989

The False Claims act was first enacted in 1863 in response to massive fraud perpetrated by companies providing supplies to the Union Army during the Civil War. The law allowed a whistle-blower to sue, on behalf of the government, a person or company that was submitting falsified claims to the government.

In 1943, Congress amended the False Claims Act, drastically reducing the share of the settlement a whistle-blower would receive and limiting the evidence or information a whistle-blower could use in the lawsuit. As a result, the law fell in to disuse.

In the mid-1980s, the media carried numerous stories about defense contractors perpetrating fraud against the government. Congress responded by amending the False Claims Act again, making it easier for people to put together a successful lawsuit and allowing whistle-blowers to receive between 15 and 30% of settlements, while also providing certain protections against retaliation by their employers.

The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 establishes certain safeguards for federal employees and former employees who claim negative personnel actions have been taken against them for whistle-blowing. 

### Morality of Whistle-blowing

#### Whistle-Blowers Cause Harm

- typical corporate response is to condemn it
- they are disloyal to their companies
	- they generate bad publicity
	- disrupt the social fabric of an organization
	- make it more difficult for everyone to work together
- while it is the responsibility of engineers to point out technical problems, the management is ultimately responsible for decisions being made, both good and bad. If management makes a mistake, the public has recourse through the legal system to seek damages from the company, and the board of directors of CEO can replace the managers who have used bad judgment.
	- The weakness in this response is its cavalier and overly legalistic attitude toward public harm

#### Whistle-Blowing is a Sign of Organizational Failure

- Since whistle-blowing is a sign of failure, organizations need to find a way to prevent it from happening in the first place. Some suggest that organizations can eliminate the need for whistle-blowing by creating management structures and communication processes that allow concerns to be raised, discussed, and resolved.
- This may be easier said than done—Robert Spitzer observes that organizations have shifted away from principle-based to utilitarian decision making. 

#### Whistle-Blowing as a Moral Duty

Richard De George believes whistle-blowers should ask themselves five questions:

1. Do you believe the problem may result in "serious and considerable harm to the public"?
2. Have you told your manager your concerns about the potential harm?
3. Have you tried every possible channel within the organization to resolve the problem?
4. Have you documented evidence that would persuade a neutral outsider that your view is correct?
5. Are you reasonably sure that if you do bring this matter to public attention, something can be done to prevent the anticipated harm?

According to De George, you have a right to whistle-blow if you answer yes to the first three, and a duty if you answer yes to all. These requirements are controversial, however.

Moral responsibility is different from other kinds of responsibility. First, moral responsibility must be borne by people—we cannot assign moral responsibility to a corporation or any other organization.

Second, moral responsibility is different from role responsibility, causal responsibility, and legal responsibility in that it isn't exclusive. **Role responsibility** is responsibility borne because of a person's assigned duties. **Causal responsibility** is responsibility assigned to people because they did something that caused something to happen. **Legal responsibility** is responsibility assigned by law. These can be exclusive; for example, if one person is responsible for paying the bills, the other employees are not. Moral responsibility isn't exclusive; for example, if an infant is brought into a home, both the mother and the father are responsible for the baby's well-doing.

Michael McFarland argues that a team of engineers should be held to a higher level of moral responsibility than any of its individual members. There may well be situation where a person has a duty to speak the truth. to this duty, McFarland adds another duty held by moral agents: the duty to help others in need. If whistle-blowing should be done and no individual has the strength to do it, then it must be done by the group acting collectively.
