## IP Addressing

>[!info] IP address
>a unique global address for a network interface

- **Exceptions:**
	- IP addresses are dynamically assigned (→ DHCP)
	- IP addresses in private networks (→ NAT)

An **IPv4** address:
- is a 32 bit long identifier
- encodes a network number (network prefix) and a host number

### Network Prefix and Host Number

- The network prefix identifies a network and the host number identifies a specific host (actually, an **interface** on the network)

**How do we know how long the network prefix is?**
- A netmask

- CIDR notation: 128.143.137.144/16
	- Notation /16 means the network prefix is 16 bits long

### Special IP Addresses

- **IP address of a network**
	- Host number is set to all zeros, e.g., 128.143.0.0
		- Host number with all zero bits is not valid
- **Broadcast address**
	- Host number is all ones, e.g., 128.143.255.255
		- Host number with all one bits is not valid
		- Broadcast goes to all hosts on the network
	- Often ignored due to security concerns
- **Loopback Interfaces**
	- All addresses 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.255 are reserved for loopback interfaces
		- Most systems use 127.0.0.1 as loopback address
	- Loopback interface is associated with name "localhost"
