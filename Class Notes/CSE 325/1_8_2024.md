## Academic Integrity

- Projects - You can discuss and help each other out at a conceptual level. You cannot share code or reports.
- Quizzes and Exams - You cannot discuss with peers during quiz time either in class or online.
- In-Class Activities - You can work together in groups.

## Course Goals

- Program and analyze embedded microprocessor systems.
- Design digital systems for embedded systems applications.
- Crude Terms - Pseudo code and Debugging.

## Embedded Systems

- No OS
- Dedicated to a specific task
- Cost-Sensitive
- Must meet real-time constraints
- Must be durable and reliable
	- environmental conditions
	- software malfunctions
- Low resources
- High Availability

### Real-Time Constraints

>[!note] real-time system
>Must respond to events when they happen or as shortly thereafter as possible.

>[!note] Soft Real-Time (SRT)
>Nothing terrible will happen if the system doesn't respond in time.

>[!note] Hard Real-Time (HRT)
>Catastrophic failure if the system doesn't respond in time.

### Embedded System vs. OS vs RTOS

| ES                                       | OS                                       | RTOS |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Hardware + Software for a single purpose | Software for scheduling and multitasking | Software for response under real-time constraints    |
