## Signals

- **Definition:** A variable quantity that represents information (voltage, current, physical quantity that conveys info from one point to another).
- **Representation:** Represented by lines with arrows indicating the direction of signal flow. These lines connect various components.
- **Examples:** Power supply voltages, I/O data, clock signals

## Node Names

- **Definition:** Represent specific points where

## Buses/Wires

- Buses = multiple wires (D0, D1, D2, D3...)
	- Common in parallel communication

Before PCB generation = schematic design

- What is the identifier of the Low Dropout Regulator IC in this schematic?
	- IC2
- What is the value of C4 in the schematic below?
	- 0.1 uF
- What is the part number of the transistor in the schematic below?
	- 2N2222 - Part number
	- Q1 - identifier
- Given the schematic, what devices are connected to signal SCK?
	- 4050D - Buffer
	- D13? DIGITALS2? Arduino?
- What is the task of this circuit?
	- The task of the circuit is to take a voltage and convert it to a stable output voltage. That is, if the output voltage was 5V, then the circuit should be able to take something like 7V or something like 3.3V and still output 5V.
- What is Vout?
	- The value of Vout from the datasheet is 3.3V or 160mA
- What is the range of Vin?
	- The range of Vin is 3.1V to 4.2V
