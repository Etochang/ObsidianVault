## 7.1 Basic Principles

### 7.1.1. The Basis for Amplifier Operation

>When we operate a transistor in the active region, we create a voltage-controlled current source.

For a MOSFET, this is the saturation/pinch-off region, where the voltage between gate and source, $v_{GS}$, controls the drain current $i_D$:
$$i_D = \frac{1}{2} k_n (v_{GS} - V_{tn})^2$$
For a BJT, this is the active region, where the base-emitter voltage $v_{BE}$ controls the collector current $i_C$ :
$$i_C = I_S e^{v_{BE}/V_T}$$

In the MOSFET model, $i_D$ doesn't depend on $v_{DS}$ because the channel is pinched off, "isolating" the drain ($v_{GD} \le V_{tn}$ | $v_{DS} \ge v_{OV}$). Similarly, in the BJT model, $i_C$ doesn't depend on $v_{CE}$ because the CBJ is reverse-biased, thus "isolating" the connector ($v_{BC} \le 0.4$ | $v_{CE} \ge 0.3$).

### 7.1.2 Obtaining a Voltage Amplifier

We see from above that the transistor is basically a **transconductance amplifier**: that is, an amplifier with an input voltage and output current. 

A simple way to convert a transconductance amplifier to a voltage amplifier is to pass the output current through a resistor and take the voltage across the resistor as the output.

In the figures above, the output voltage is taken between the drain/collector and ground instead of across the load resistor because a **common ground reference** is needed between the input and output signals. 
$$v_{DS} = V_{DD} - i_DR_D$$
$$v_{CE} = V_{CC}-i_CR_C$$

### 7.1.3 The Voltage-Transfer Characteristic (VTC)

The VTC is simply a plot of the output voltage versus the input voltage.

The segment of greatest slope (hence potentially largest amplifier gain) is AB, which corresponds to operation in the active region. **To use a transistor as an amplifier, we confine its operating point to the segment AB**. 

The coordinates of B for MOSFET are:
$$V_{GS} \Bigr\rvert_B = V_t + \frac{\sqrt{2k_nR_DV_{DD}+1}-1}{k_nR_D}$$
$$V_{DS}\Bigr\rvert_B = V_{OV}\Bigr\rvert_B \equiv \frac{\sqrt{2k_nR_DV_{DD}+1}-1}{k_nR_D}$$
For BJT:
$$V_{BE} \Bigr\rvert_B = 0.7 V$$
$$V_{CE} \Bigr\rvert_B = 0.3 V$$

### 7.1.4 Obtaining Linear Amplification by Biasing the Transistor

Biasing enables us to obtain almost-linear amplification from the MOSFET and the BJT. 

We select a dc input voltage $V_{GS}$ or $V_{BE}$ to obtain operation at a point Q on the segment AB of the VTC. Point Q is known as the **bias point** or the **dc operating point**. It is also known as the **quiescent point**.

Next, the signal to be amplified, $v_{gs}$ or $v_{be}$, a function of time $t$, is superimposed on the bias voltage
