## Object Relationships

- A large software system consists of many objects that are related to each other in various ways
- Class relationships can be:
	- structural - objects share data and methods
		- association - more loosely coupled connections
			- aggregation - "has a" relationship
			- composition - "whole to part" relationship
		- generalization (inheritance)
	- non-structural (dependency) - objects don't share attributes or methods; one calls the other

### Inheritance

Arrow from specialized to general. "is a" relationship.

- In OOP, inheritance is a relationship between:
	- superclass - a more generalized class
	- subclass - a more specialized class
- The subclass 'inherits' data and behavior from the superclass
- inheritance supports method overriding and method overloading
