# Fundamentals of Object Oriented Analysis and Design

## What is OOP❔

- OOP concerns the design of software modules of a system as a collection of objects.
- An object represents a collection of related **functionality** and **data** 

## What is an Object❔

- a computational entity that encapsulates data and related methods
- In a large system, objects are related to each other and communicate with each other at runtime while performing system operations

## Foundations of Software Design

1. Abstraction: data and procedural abstraction
2. Modularity: how well objects abstract underlying data and procedures so that each object is as independent as possible
3. Architecture: the overall structure of the software system. Organization of objects in the design and their behavior at runtime

### Representing Data and Procedural Abstractions

- An encapsulated object can be thought of as a *black box* - its inner workings are hidden from the client
- OOP facilitates **Encapsulation and information hiding**.
- The client invokes the interface methods of the object, which manages the instance data

### Why Information Hiding❔

- Reduces the likelihood of "side effects"
- limits the global impact of local design decisions
- emphasizes communication through controlled interfaces
- discourages the use of global data leads to encapsulation - an attribute of high-quality design
- results in higher quality software
