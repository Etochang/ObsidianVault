# Incremental Software Process Model

## Incremental Development

![[Pasted image 20240602190509.png]]

- Specification, development and validation are interleaved.

## Benefits

- cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced
	- amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less that waterfall model
- It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been done
	- customers can comment on demonstrations of the software and see how much has been implemented
- More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible.

## Problems

- The process is not visible
	- Managers need regular deliverables to measure progress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to produce documents that reflect every version of the system.
- System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added.
	- unless time/money is spent on refactoring to improve the software, regular change tends to corrupt its structure.
