# Waterfall Software Process Models

## Model

![[Pasted image 20240602185549.png]]

- There are separate identified phases in the model:
	- Requirements analysis and definition
	- System and software design
	- Implementation and Unit Testing
	- Integration and system testing
	- Operation and maintenance
- In principle, one phase has to be completed before moving onto the next phase.

## Problems

- Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.
	- Therefore, this is only appropriate when the requirements are well understood, and changes will be fairly limited during the design process.
	- Few business systems have stable requirements
- this model is also good if a large system is developed at several sites. In those circumstances, the plan-driven nature of the waterfall model helps coordinate the work.

## Prototyping Variation

- Stakeholders can look at the prototype
- Several iterations can be used to refine the design and requirements

## V-Model

- Adds flexibility with feedback loops
