# Software Process Models

## What is a Process Model❔

- A structured set of activities required to develop a software system.
- Many different software processes but all involve:
	- Specification - defining what the system should do
	- Design and implementation - defining the organization of the system and implementing the system
	- Validation - checking that it does what the customer wants
	- Evolution - changing the system in response to changing customer needs
- Software process model - an abstract representation of a process. It presents how different process activities are organized for a given process model

## Waterfall vs Incremental Approaches

- Waterfall - processes where all of the process activities are planned in-advance, and progress is measure against this plan. 
- Incremental - planning is incremental, and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
- In practice, most practical processes include elements of both.
- There are no right/wrong software processes
