# Project Planning

>Project planning involves breaking down the work into parts and assigning these to project team members, anticipating problems that might arise and preparing tentative solutions to those problems.

>The project plan, which is created at the start of a project, is used to communicate how the work will be done to the project team and customers, and to help assess progress on the project.

## Planning Stages

1. Proposal Stage
	- When you are bidding for a contract to develop or provide a software system
2. Project Startup Phase
	- When you have to plan who will work on the project, how the project will be broken down into increments, how resources will be allocated across your company, etc.
3. Development Phase
	- Periodically throughout the project, when you modify your plan in the light of experience gained and information from monitoring the progress of the work

Can go back to previous stage if plan needs revising.

### Proposal Planning

- Planning may be necessary with only outline software requirements
	- UI mockup
- The aim of planning at this stage is to provide info that will be used in **setting a price** for the system to customers
- Project pricing involves estimating how much the software will cost to develop, taking factors such as staff costs, hardware costs, software costs, etc. into account

### Project Startup Planning

- At this stage, you know more about the system requirements but do not have design or implementation information
- Create a plan with enough detail to make decisions about the project budget and staffing
	- this plan is the basis for project resource allocation
- The startup plan should also define project monitoring mechanisms
- A startup plan is still needed for agile development to allow resources to be allocated to the project

### Development Planning

- The project plan should be regularly amended as the project progresses and you known more about the software and its development
- The project schedule, cost-estimate and risks have to be regularly revised
- Project Planning also depends on software Development Strategy: Plan Driven or Agile

## Plan-Driven vs Agile Development

![[Pasted image 20240524185207.png]]
- Requirements are well-defined
- Not expecting too much change

![[Pasted image 20240524185127.png]]
- Good if we expect a lot of change
- Requirements aren't well-defined

## Plan-Driven Development

- Plan-driven or plan-based development is an approach to software engineering where the development process is planned in detail
	- Plan-driven development is based on engineering project management techniques and is the 'traditional' way of managing large software development projects
- A project plan is created that records the work to be done, who will do it, the development schedule and the work products
- Managers use the plan to support project decision making and as a way of measuring progress

**Pros**:
- early planning allows organizational issues (availability of staff, other projects, etc.) to be closely taken into account
- potential problems and dependencies are discovered before the project starts, rather than once the project is underway
**Cons**:
- Many early decisions have to be revised because of changes to the environment in which the software is to be developed and used

### Project Plans

- In a plan-driven development project, a project plan sets out the resources available to the project, the work breakdown and a schedule for carrying out the work.
- Sections:
	- **Introduction**: what is the main goal of the project, who is involved (stakeholders)
	- **Project organization**: staffing and team structure, tools that you might need to use for the software
	- **Risk analysis**: and contingency plan for the risks
	- **Hardware and software resource requirements**: properly listed
	- **Work breakdown**: create schedule of working and assign staff
	- **Project schedule**: Set up milestones and timeline
	- **Monitoring and reporting mechanisms**: how we evaluate milestones and who will be doing the evaluation, and based on evaluation how do we adapt if changes are needed

### The Planning Process

- iterative process that starts when you create an initial project plan during the project startup phase
- Plan changes are inevitable
	- business goal change
	- new system information

### Planning Assumptions

- You should make realistic rather than optimistic assumptions when you are defining a project plan
- Problems of some description always arise during a project, and these lead to project delays
- Your initial assumptions and scheduling should take unexpected problems into account
- You should include contingency in your plan so that if things go wrong, then your delivery schedule is not seriously disrupted

### Risk Mitigation

- If there are serious problems with the development work that are likely to lead to significant delays, you need to initiate risk mitigation actions to reduce the risks of project failure
- In conjunction with these actions, you also have to replan the project
- This may involve renegotiating the project constraints and deliverables with the customer. A new schedule of when work should be completed also has to be established and agreed with the customer.
