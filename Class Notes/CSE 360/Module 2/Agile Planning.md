# Agile Planning

- Agile methods of software development are **iterative approaches** where the software is developed and delivered to customers in increments
- Unlike plan-driven approaches, the functionality of these increments is not planned in advance but is decided **during** the development
	- The decision on what to include in an increment depends on progress and on the customer's priorities
- The customer's priorities and requirements change so it makes sense to have a flexible plan that can accommodate these changes

## Main Goals

- Program specification, design, and implementation are interleaved
- The system is developed as a series of versions/increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation
- Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation. Extensive tool support used to support development (i.e. automated testing tools).
- Minimal documentation - focus on working code
- Iteration planning, which has a shorter-term outlook, and focuses on planning the next increment of a system. This is typically 2-4 weeks of work for the team
## Story-based Planning

- The planning game is based on user stories that reflect the features that should be included in the system
- The project team read and discuss the stories and rank them in order of the amount of time they think it will take to implement the story
- Stories are assigned 'effort points' reflecting their size/difficult of implementation
- The number of effort points implemented per day is measured giving an estimate of the team's velocity
- This allows the total effort required to implement the system to be estimated

### Task-allocation

- During the task planning stage, the developers break down stories into development tasks.
	- A dev. task should take 4-16 hours
	- All of the tasks that must be completed to implement all the stories in that iteration are listed
	- The individual developers then sign up for the specific tasks that they will implement
- Benefits of this approach:
	- The whole team gets an overview of the tasks to be completed in an iteration
	- Developers have a sense of ownership in these tasks and this is likely to motivate them to complete the task (individual responsibility)

## Software Delivery

- A software increment is always delivered at the end of each project iteration
- If the features to be included in the increment cannot be completed in the time allowed, the scope of the work is reduced
- The delivery schedule is never extended

## Planning Difficulties

- Agile planning is reliant on customer involvement and availability
- This can be difficult to arrange as representatives sometimes have to prioritize other work and are not available for the planning game
- Furthermore, some customers may be more familiar with traditional project plans and may find it difficult to engage with agile

## Applicability

- Agile planning works well with small, stable dev. teams that can get together and discuss the stories to be implemented
- However, where teams are large and/or geographically distributed, or when team membership changes frequently, it is practically impossible for everyone to be involved in the collaborative planning that is essential for agile project management.
