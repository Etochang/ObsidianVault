# Software Engineering Ethics
- Software engineering involves wider responsibilities than simply the application of technical skills
- Software engineers must behave in an honest and ethically responsible way if they are to be respected as professionals
- Ethical behavior is more than simply upholding the law, but involves following a set of principles that are morally correct

## Issues of Professional Responsibility

- Confidentiality
	- Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed
- Competence
	- Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is out of their competence
- Intellectual Property Rights
	- Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents, copyright, etc. They should be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected
- Computer misuse
	- Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse other people's computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing) to extremely serious (virus spreading)

## ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics

- The profession societies in the US have produced a code of ethical practice
- Members of these organizations sign up to the code of practice when they join
- They contain eight principles related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and policymakers, as well as trainees and students of the profession.
