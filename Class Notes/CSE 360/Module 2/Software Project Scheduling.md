# Software Project Scheduling

- Project scheduling is the process of deciding how the work in a project will be **organized** as separate tasks, and **when** and **how** these tasks will be executed
- Estimate the calendar time needed to complete each task, the effort required, and who will work on the tasks that have been identified
- Estimate the resources needed to complete each task, such as the disk space required on a server, the time required on specialized hardware, such as a simulator, and what the travel budget will be

## Scheduling Activities

- Split project into tasks and estimate time and resources required to complete each task
- Organize tasks concurrently to make optimal use of workforce
- Minimize task dependencies to avoid delays caused by one task waiting for another to complete
- Dependent on project manager's intuition and experience
- Milestones in project schedule used for feedback loop back to estimating resources

### Project Activities and Scheduling

- Project activities (tasks) are the basic planning element. Each activity has:
	- a duration in calendar days or months
	- an effort estimate, which shows the number of person-days/months to complete the work
	- a deadline by which the activity should be complete
	- a defined end-point, which might be a document, the holding of a review meeting, the successful execution of all tests, etc

## Scheduling Problems

- Estimating the difficulty of problems and hence the cost of developing a solution is hard
- Productivity is not proportional to the number of people working on a task
- Adding people to a late project makes it later because of communication overheads
- The unexpected always happens; always allow contingency in planning
