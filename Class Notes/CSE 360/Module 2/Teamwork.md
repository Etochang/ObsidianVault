# Teamwork

## Software Teams

- Software engineering is a group activity
	- For non-trivial software projects, it is almost impossible that one person can complete it
- A good group is cohesive and has a team spirit. The people involved are motivated by the success of the group as well as by their own personal goals
- Group interaction is a key determinant of group performance

## Group Cohesiveness

- members consider the group to be more important than any individual in it
- The advantages of a cohesive group are:
	- group quality standards can be developed by the group members
	- team members learn from each other and get to know each other's work; inhibitions caused by ignorance are reduced
	- knowledge is shared; continuity can be maintained if a group member leaves
	- refactoring and continual improvement is encouraged; group members work collectively to deliver high quality results and fix problems, irrespective of the individuals who originally created the design or program

## Team Spirit

- inclusivity
- encouragement
- investment
- benefits
- getting to know each other
- socially fun

## Team Models

**Types Commonly Used:**
- Chief Programmer Team (CPT)
	- hierarchical
- Matrix Management (MM)
	- assembly line, linear
- Self Directed Work Teams (SDWT)
	- no specific structure

### Chief Programmer Team

- A hierarchical chief programmer team:

- **Characteristics:**
	- 5-10 programmers
	- led by a chief programmer
	- all supervised by a manager
	- hierarchical structure
	- all members active throughout development, one or two programmers responsible for software QA
- **Advantages:**
	- established chain of command
	- easy accountability
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Success dependent upon competence of chief programmer
	- non-specialist programmers for each task

- Good for projects where requirements are clearly defined and requirements can easily be divided into tasks that can be distributed among programmers
- mostly applicable for plan-driven approach
- not suitable for teams where requirements aren't clearly defined or requirements can't be divided into tasks that can be distributed among programmers

### Matrix Management

![[Pasted image 20240526151828.png]]

- **Characteristics:** 
	- Each member of the group has a specialized role
	- Remains in the group only when his services are needed
	- These members may be moved to other projects when their assigned tasks are completed
- **Advantages:**
	- Matrix assures that projects get specially trained people in all activities
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Difficult to have a good schedule once delays are induced
	- Lot of communication
	- Accountability is often a problem

- Good for companies developing multiple projects simultaneously and each phase of these projects need specialized people

### Self Directed Work Teams

![[Pasted image 20240526152127.png]]

- **Characteristics:**
	- There is no technical leader
	- No external management
	- No matrix groupings
	- Teams empowered to conduct all activities like hiring, planning, scheduling, tracking, rewarding, etc.
- **Advantages:**
	- Good cohesiveness between team members
	- minimum external influence
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Difficult to track progress

- Good for projects where requirements are not clearly defined and unclear. Specifically, research and development type projects.

## Team Leader

- Project management is people-intensive
- Practitioners often don't have the right mix of people skills
- The MOI model of leadership:
	- **Motivation:** the ability to encourage (by push or pull) technical people to produce to their best ability
	- **Organization:** the ability to mold existing processes (or invent new ones) that will enable the initial concept to be translated into a final product
	- **Ideas or Innovation:** the ability to encourage people to create and feel creative even when they must work within bounds established for a particular software product or application

## The effectiveness of a team

- The people in the group (team composition)
	- diverse and specialized
- The group organization
	- so that individuals can contribute to the best of their abilities
- Technical and managerial communications
	- good communication between team members and stakeholders is essential

### Composition

The following factors must be considered when selecting a software project team structure:

- The **difficulty** of the problem to be solved
- The **size** of the resultant **program**(s) in lines of code or function points
- The **time** that the team will stay together (team lifetime)
- The degree to which the problem can be **modularized**
- The required **quality** and **reliability** of the system to be built
- The **rigidity** of the **delivery date**
- The degree of sociability (**communication**) required for the project

- Groups composed of members who share the same motivation can be problematic:
	- Task-oriented - everyone wants to do their own thing
	- Self-oriented - everyone wants to be the boss
	- Interaction-oriented - too much chatting, not much work
- An effective group has a balance of all types
- This can be difficult to achieve, as software engineers are usually task-oriented
- Interaction-oriented people are very important as they can detect and defuse tension as they arise

## Key Points

- People management involves choosing the right people and organizing the team and its working environment
- People are motivated by interaction, the recognition of management and their peers, and by being given opportunities for personal development
- Groups should be fairly small and cohesive. The key factors that influence the effectiveness of a group are the people in that group, the way it is organized and the communication between group members
- Communications are influenced by factors such as status of group members, size of the group, gender composition, personalities and available communication channels
