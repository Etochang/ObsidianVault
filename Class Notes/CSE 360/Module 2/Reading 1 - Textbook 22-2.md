## 22-2 Managing People

- Good:
	- people are respected
	- assigned responsibilities that reflect their skills and experience

>Four critical factors that influence the relationship between a manager and the people that he or she manages:

1. **Consistency:** all the people in a team should be treated in a comparable way. No one expects all rewards to be identical, but undervaluation is unacceptable
2. **Respect:** different people have different skills, and managers should respect these differences. Opportunities should be given equally
3. **Inclusion:** people contribute effectively when they feel that others listen to them and take account of their proposals.
4. **Honesty:** as a manager, you should always be honest about what is going well and what is going badly in the team. Also be honest about technical knowledge.

### Motivating People

>Motivation means organizing work and its environment to encourage people to work as effectively as possible.

- Maslow suggests that people are motivated by satisfying their needs.

- Physiological needs - fundamental needs for sleep/food, etc.
- Safety needs - need for shelter
- Social needs - need for being part of a social group
- Esteem needs - need to be respected by others
- Self-realization needs - concerned with personal development

Social, esteem, and self-realization are most relevant in a software development organization.

1. Places/time for people to get together and meet; teleconferencing is okay, but face-to-face is important
2. Public recognition of achievements for esteem needs, as well as pay
3. Responsibility for their own work, opportunities for training and development, as well as demanding (but not impossible) tasks for self-realization

### The People Capability Maturity Model

Three classifications for professional workers:

1. Task-oriented people, who are motivated by the work they do
2. Self-oriented people, who are principally motivated by personal success and recognition
3. Interaction-oriented people, who are motivated by the presence and actions of co-workers

## 22-3 Teamwork

A good group is cohesive and thinks of itself as a strong, single unit. The people involved are motivated by the success of the group as well as by their own personal goals.

**Benefits**:
1. The group can establish its own quality standards
2. Individuals learn from and support each other
3. Knowledge is shared
4. Refactoring and continual improvement is encouraged

Inclusivity and trust

Given a stable organizational and project environment, the three factors that have the biggest effect on team working are:
1. The people in the group
2. The way the group is organized
3. Technical and managerial communications

### Selecting Group Members

Strike a balance of task-oriented, self-oriented, and interaction-oriented.

### Group Organization

- Should the project manager be the technical leader of the group?
	- For large projects, it is best to separate technical and managerial roles
- Who will be involved in making critical technical decisions, and how will these decisions be made? Will decisions be made by hierarchy or through consensus?
- How will interactions with external stakeholders and company management be handled?
- How can groups integrate people who are not co-located?
- How can knowledge be shared across the group?

### Hiring the Right People

Key Factors:
- Education and training
- Application domain and technology experience
- Communication ability
- Adaptability
- Problem-solving ability

Small programming groups are usually more informal - Agile teams are always informal. Informal groups can be very successful, particularly when most group members are experienced and competent.

In hierarchical groups, the group leader is at the top. There is a clear organizational structure. They work well when a well-understood problem can be easily broken down into software components that can be developed in different parts of the hierarchy. This allows for rapid decision-making; however, it rarely works well for complex software engineering. 

In software development, effective team communications at all levels is essential:
1. Changes to the software often requires changes to several parts of the system
2. Software tech changes so fast that more junior staff may know more about new tech than experienced staff.

### Group Communications

The effectiveness and efficiency of communications are influenced by:
1. Group size: the number of one-way communication links is $n*(n-1)$ where $n$ is the group size. 
2. Group structure: hierarchical - communication flows up and down, not side to side, informal - communication is like a fully-connected graph
3. Group composition: personality types, gender groups, etc.
4. The physical work environment: organization of the workplace
5. The available communication channels: face-to-face, email, social media platforms, etc.

## Key Points

- Good software project management is essential for the schedule and the budget
- Software management is distinct from other engineering management. Software is intangible, and software processes are not as mature as traditional engineering processes
- Risk management involves identifying and assessing major project risks to establish the probability that they will occur and the consequences for the project if that risk does arise
- People management involves choosing the right people to work on a project and organizing the team and its working environment so that they are as productive as possible
- People are motivated by interaction with other people, by the recognition of management and their peers, and by being given opportunities for personal development
- Software dev. groups should be fairly small and cohesive. The key factors for effectiveness are the people in the group, the organization of the group, and the communication between group members
