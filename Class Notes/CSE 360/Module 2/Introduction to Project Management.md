# Introduction to Project Management

## Software Project Management

**Main Goals:**
- Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time (according to schedule constraints)
- Keep overall costs within budget
- Deliver software that meets the customer's expectations
- Maintain a coherent and well-functioning development team

**Software Distinctions:**
- The product is intangible
	- Cannot be seen or touched. Project managers cannot see progress by simply looking at the artefact that is being constructed
- Many software projects are 'one-off' projects
	- Large software projects are usually different in some ways from previous projects. Even managers who have lots of previous experience may find it difficult to anticipate problems
- Software processes are variable and organization specific
	- We still cannot reliably predict when a particular software process is likely to lead to development problems

## Factors Influencing Project Management

- Company size
- Software customer type(s)
- Software size
- Software type
- Organizational culture
- Software development processes

## Universal Management Activities

- Project Planning
	- Project managers are responsible for planning, estimating, and scheduling project development and assigning people to tasks
- Risk Management
	- Project managers assess the risks that may affect a project, monitor these risks and take action when problems arise
- People Management
	- Project managers have to choose people for their team and establish ways of working that leads to effective team performance
- Proposal Writing
	- Project managers are usually responsible for reporting on the progress of a project to customers and to the managers of the company developing the software
- Reporting
	- The first stage in a software project may involve writing a proposal to win a contract to carry out an item of work. The proposal describes the objectives of the project and how it will be carried out

## Summary

>Software project management is concerned with activities that maintain a coherent and well-functional development team that ensure timely product delivery on budget that satisfy customer expectations.

>Key activities in software project management are project planning, risk management, people management, reporting and proposal writing.
