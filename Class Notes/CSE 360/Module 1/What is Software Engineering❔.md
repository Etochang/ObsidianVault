# What is Software Engineering❔

## Objectives

1. What is Engineering: how do we describe the engineering discipline?
2. What is Software Engineering: how is software engineered?
3. Software Engineering as a Four Layered Technology: main pillars of software engineering

## What is Engineering❔

>Engineering is the application of scientific principles towards practical ends.

>Using appropriate theories and methods to solve problems, bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints.

## Software Engineering❔

- Concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.
- Different aspects of software production:
	- process of development
	- project management and development of tools
	- methods, etc.

## Four-Layered Technology

**Quality**: Conformance to explicitly stated *functional* and *performance* requirements, explicitly documented *development standards*, and implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed software.

User satisfaction = compliant product + good quality + delivery within budget and schedule

**Process Model**: Defines a framework that uses software engineering methods to build quality software.

**Methods**: Technical details about how to's for building software.

**Tools**: Provides automated or semi-automated support for methods and process.

>Systematic application of software engineering activities (and body of knowledge of software engineering and computer science) to build state-of-the-art software systems
