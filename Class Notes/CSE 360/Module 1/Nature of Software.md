# Nature of Software

## Objectives

1. Software and Society: influence of software and computer technology in today's society
2. Broader Categories of Software: different types of software systems
3. Software Characteristics: properties of software compared to other engineering products
4. Software Life-Cycle: what happens to a software product over its time of usage

## Law of Unintended Consequence

>Invention of one technology can have profound and unexpected effects on seemingly unrelated technologies. Like the *butterfly effect*. 

Computer technology has conquered our world today:

- system software - compiler, networking
- application software - standalone for a specific need
- engineering/scientific software - astronomy, molecular biology...
- embedded software - control for a microwave
- product-line software - inventory control, word processing, spreadsheets
- Web applications - set of linked hypertext files
- AI software - robotics, pattern recognition, game playing

## Software - Two Broader Categories

### Generic Products

- Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
	- PC software
	- CAD software
	- Project management tools
	- etc.
- The specification of what the software should do is determined by the software developer and changes are made by the developer.

### Customized Products

- Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.
	- Embedded control systems
	- air traffic control software
	- traffic monitoring systems
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the customer for the software and they make decisions on what changes are required.

## Software vs Hardware

- Hardware wears out; software deteriorates
- Hardware is manufactured; software is engineered

## Software Life-Cycle
