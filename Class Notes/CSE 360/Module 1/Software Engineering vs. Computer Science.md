# Software Engineering vs. Computer Science

## Objectives

1. What is CS?
2. SE vs. CS
3. A well-engineered software project: characteristics

## What is Computer Science❔

Computer science primarily focuses on **fundamental principles** (theoretical aspect) of software, software systems, and computers.

Major areas:
- Algorithm design techniques
- Software analysis and design principles
- Computer networks
- Computer architecture
- Information management systems
- etc.

Computer science fundamental principles form the key **body of knowledge** required to develop and deliver software and software systems.

## SE vs. CS

Used together to form a project. **Team is important**.

## A Well-Engineered Software Project

Software team works on achieving project goals, product goals, and strike a balance between them.

>[!info] Product goals
>- Minimal defects
>- Maximum user satisfaction
>- Minimal response time
>- Good maintainability
>- Good extendibility
>- High robustness
>- High correctness

>[!info] Project goals
>- Short schedule
>- Predictable delivery date
>- Low cost
>- Small team size
>- Flexibility to make mid-project feature-set changes
