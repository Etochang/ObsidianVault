# Software Engineering Process Activities

## Objectives

1. Main Software Process Activities
2. Broader Categories of Software Process Activities
3. Organization of Categories

## Software Process Activities

>[!info] Software Specification
>Where customers, stakeholders, and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.

>[!info] Software Development
>Where the software is designed and programmed.

>[!info] Software Validation
>Where software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.

>[!info] Software Evolution
>Where software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

### Software Specification

- The process of establishing what services are required and the constraints on the system's operation and development.
- **Requirement Engineering**
	- Requirements elicitation and analysis
		- What do the system stakeholders require or expect from the system?
	- Requirements specification
		- Defining the requirements in detail
	- Requirements validation
		- Checking the validity of the requirements

### Software Development

- Overall objective is to convert the system specification into an executable system.
	- Software design: design a software structure that realizes the specification
	- Implementation: translate this structure into an executable program
- The activities of design and implementation are closely related and may be inter-leaved.

- Platform information - deployment and development platform
- Data description - how and where data should be stored
- Architecture - blueprint of the system; general layout
- Interface - connection between components
- Component - each function
### Software Validation

- **Verification** and **Validation**: intended to show that a system **conforms to its specification** and **meets the requirements of the system customer**. 
- Reviews and Testing are the most commonly used V&V activity.

### Software Evolution

- Software needs to be flexible for changes (changing business circumstances)

## Revised Definition of SE

>Organization of software process activities (specification, development, validation and evolution) and the application of body of knowledge of CS and relevant disciplines to deliver software product that satisfies functional and non-functional requirements

- Software lifecycle models
- Software project management
- Software development methods and tools
	- Information management
	- Object oriented analysis and design
	- Algorithms and data structures
	- Coding and codebase management
- Software testing
- Software QA
