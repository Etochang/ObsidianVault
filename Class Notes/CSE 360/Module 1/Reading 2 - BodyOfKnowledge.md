- **Essential Properties:** properties that a thing must have to be that thing
- **Accidental Properties:** properties that arise by happenstance and do not affect the basic "thingness" of the thing

Specific programming language and checking fidelity of representation (coding and testing) are accidental; Specification, design, and verification are the essential properties.

Essential difficulties:
- Complexity - large scope, translation from real-world concepts to program
- Conformity - pre-existing hardware, third-party components, regulations, etc.
- Changeability - evolution will outpace maintainability as software gets more popular
- Invisibility - lack of visualization

Stable Core makes of about 50% of the knowledge needed to develop a software system.

Categories of possible knowledge in the software engineering body of knowledge:

>[!important] Core Competencies for Software Engineering
>- **Software Requirements**: the discovery, documentation, and analysis of the function to be implemented in software
>- **Software Design**: definition of the basic structure of the system at the architectural and detailed levels, division into modules, definition of interfaces for modules, and choice of algorithms within modules
>- **Software Construction**: implementation of the software including detailed design, coding, debugging, unit testing, technical reviews, and performance optimization. This area overlaps somewhat with Software Design and Software Testing
>- **Software Testing**: all activities associated with executing software to detect defects and evaluate features. Testing includes test planning, test case design, and specific kinds of tests including development tests, unit tests, component tests, integration tests, system tests, regression tests, stress tests, and acceptance tests
>- **Software Maintenance**: revision and enhancement of existing software, related documentation, and tests
>- **Software Configuration Management**: identification, documentation, and change control of all intellectual property generated on a software project including source code, content (graphics, sound, text, and video), requirements, designs, test materials, estimates, plans, and user documentation
>- **Software Quality**: all activities associated with providing confidence that a software item conforms or will conform to technical requirements. Quality engineering includes QA planning, quality measurement, reliability, testing, technical reviews, audits, and verification and validation
>- **Software Engineering Management**: planning, tracking, and controlling of a software project, software work, or a software organization
>- **Software Engineering Tools and Methods**: tool and methodology support, such as CASE tools, reusable code libraries, and formal methods, including practices for adopting and disseminating tools and methods within an organization
>- **Software Engineering Process**: activities related to improving software development quality, timeliness, productivity, and other project and product characteristics
