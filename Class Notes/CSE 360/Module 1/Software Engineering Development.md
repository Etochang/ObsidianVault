# Software Engineering Development

>The term software engineering was first used at a workshop in West Germany in 1968 that considered the growing problems of software development:
>- High cost
>- Difficult to manage
>- Poor reliability
>- Lack of user acceptance
>- Difficult to maintain

We still have the same problems today, but they are on different scales; huge complex applications, with tremendous requirements.

## High Cost

- Software development is labor intensive
- Software productivity rates for engineering are around 1 loc per hour

## Difficult to Manage

- Software projects are difficult to estimate, plan, and track
- Many projects are late and over budget

## Poor Reliability

- Software defect rates are around 1 delivered defect per thousand lines of code
- With applications spanning millions of lines of code, customers experience many defects

## Lack of User Acceptance

- Today, the success of a project is often a function of its GUI

## Difficult to Maintain

- Maintenance requires both knowledge of the code as well as the application domain
