# Reading 3 - Textbook 1-1

Reasons for "software failures":

- **Increasing system complexity**: new software engineering techniques have to be developed to meet new challenges of delivering more complex software
- **Failure to use software engineering methods**: better software engineering education and training is needed to address increasing amount of software development

## 1-1 Professional Software Development

Professional software is intended for use by someone apart from its developer, and are developed by teams rather than individuals.

Software engineering is intended to support professional software development rather than individual programming.

>[!question] What is software?
>Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be developed for a particular customer (customized) or for a general market (general).

>[!question] What are the attributes of good software?
>Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the use and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.

>[!question] What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering?
>System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based systems development including hardware, software and process engineering. Software engineering is part of this more general process.

>[!question] What are the costs of software engineering?
>Roughly 60% of software costs are development costs, 40% are testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development costs.

Essential attributes of good software:

| Characteristic             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptability              | Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable, and compatible with other system that they use.                                                                                                                  |
| Dependability and security | Software dependability includes a range of characteristics including reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Software has to be secure so that malicious users cannot access or damage the system. |
| Efficiency                 | Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, resource utilizing, etc.                                                                                                         |
| Maintainability            | Software should be written in such a way that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment.                                                                     |
