# Introduction to Information Management Systems

## What is an Information Management System?

- a general term for software systems designed to facilitate the storage, organization and retrieval of information in a variety of formats and makes it easy for people to access the store information
- IMS is sometimes used synonymously with Database Management System (DBMS)
- **Features:**
	- information must be collected and stored
	- information must be manageable
	- information must be accessible

## IMS/DBMS vs RDBMS

- In a DBMS, data is generally stored in either a hierarchical form or a navigational form
- RDBMS stands for Relational DBMS - a special type of DBMS which is based on the relational model, but not every DBMS must be relational
- In a RDBMS, the tables will have an identifier called *primary key*. Data values will be stored in the form of tables, and the relationships between these values will be store in the form of a table as well.

## Data Model

- a logical structure of a database. It describes the design of the database to reflect entities, attributes, relationship among data, constraints, etc.
- **Types:**
	- object-based logical models (describing data at the conceptual and view levels)
		- ER Model
	- record-based logical models (specifying logical structure of database with records, fields, and attributes)
		- Relational Model
