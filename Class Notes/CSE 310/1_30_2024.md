## Heap

### Recurrence T(n)

- Complexities of MergeSort and QuickSort
- The runtime of a recurrent divide and conquer algorithm
	- The # of subproblems
	- Size of the input a subproblem handles
	- The cost of non-recursive operations
- Recursion tree
- Master Theorem

### What is a Heap‚ùî

- A complete binary tree data structure, 'binary heap'
- Wrapped in a 1D array
	- We can use a 1D array to implement a binary tree
- Maintains a certain heap-unique order as its key characteristic.

### Properties of a Binary Tree

- Composed of **NODES** as slots
	- Nodes can be **NULL**
- A non-empty tree has a unique **ROOT** node
- Each node connects to:
	- A **PARENT** node, **LEFT CHILD** node, **RIGHT CHILD** node
	- Left **subTREE** and Right **subTREE**, 2 branches at most
- The distance of each node to the root defines the **LAYER** the node is at
- If both of a node's children are NULL, then it's a **LEAF** node

#### Complete Binary Tree

- All layers except the last are full
- Last layer filled from left to right
	- Otherwise the left child right child index navigation formulas break

### Binary Tree Wrapped in a 1D Array

- Root is at `A[1]`
- W.r.t any node `A[i]` for navigation:
	- PARENT: `A[floor(i/2)]`
	- LEFT child: `A[i*2]`
	- RIGHT child: `A[i*2 + 1]`
- You could reserve an `A[16]` with only 12 elements used as tree/heap nodes
	- 16 is the *capacity* of the tree/heap, while 12 is the *size* of the tree/heap

### Max Heap vs. Min Heap

- Max - PARENT node's value is always $\ge$ NON-NULL children's
- Min - PARENT node's value is always $\le$ NON-NULL children's

### Major Procedures of (Max) Heap

- Max-Heapify
	- Retaining the heap property when violated
	- Only applicable when both subtrees are valid Max Heaps
- BuildHeap
	- Turning a random array into a heap array
- HeapSort
	- BuildHeap, then turning the heap array into a sorted array
