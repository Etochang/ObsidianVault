## Divide and Conquer

>[!note] MergeSort Recap
>**Backbone Philosophy**
>- Divide the n-element sequence into 2 equal halves
>- Call MergeSort recursively on the 2 unsorted halves/sub-sequences
>- Merge the 2 already sorted sub-sequences into a grand full sequence of n-elements
>  
>**Extreme Cases**
>- If n = 1: return as is, a 1-element sequence is already sorted

### In-place vs. Out-of-place

>Does your algorithm need extra space or it can't be executed?

- In-place: doesn't need extra space
- Out-of-place: needs extra space

>[!note] QuickSort, the other major Embodiment of D&C
>**Backbone Philosophy**
>- Pick a *pivot* element.
>- Scan the sequence one by one. If an element is smaller than the pivot, throw it to the Left-Partition; otherwise, throw it to the Right-Partition
>- Call QuickSort recursively on the Left-Partition and Right-Partition
>- The concatenated *Sorted Left-Partition* + *pivot* + *Sorted Right-Partition* is essentially the whole sequence sorted
> 
>**Extreme Cases**
>- If n = 1: return as is, a 1-element sequence is already sorted

### QuickSort, top-down

- Everything to the left of the pivot is smaller than it, everything to the right of the pivot is larger than it
- We don't care if the left/right partitions are ordered when pivoting.
- But after QuickSorting recursively on both Left Partition and Right Partitions, the partitions will naturally become ordered.
- **Conquer** and **Combine** done altogether.

```
QUICKSORT(A, p, r)
if p < r then
	q = PARTITION(A, p, r)
	// A[q] is the pivot element after the PARTITION routine.
	QUICKSORT(A, p, q-1)
	QUICKSORT(A, q+1, r)
```

#### PARTITION

- Choose `A[r]` as the *pivot* element
- Scan from the left until an element > `A[r]` is found
- Scan from the right until an element < `A[r]` is found
- Swap these two elements
- Repeat until scan pointers meet
- Swap `A[r]` with the element pointed to by the pointers

```
PARTITION(A, p, r)

pivot = A[r]; i = p; j = r-1;

while TRUE {
	while (j > p) {
		if A[j] < pivot
			break;
		else
			j--
	}
	while (i < r) {
		if A[i] > pivot
			break;
		else
			i++
	}
	if i < j
		Swap A[i] and A[j]
	else
		Swap A[i] and A[r]
		return
}
```

| MergeSort | QuickSort |
| ---- | ---- |
| Not 'in-place,' needs auxiliary spaces on the heap | Can be done 'in-place' with no extra space needed |
| Always O(n log n) for time complexity | Worst case time complexity is n^2 |
