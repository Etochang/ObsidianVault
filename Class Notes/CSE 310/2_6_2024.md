## A Review of Dynamic Containers

- Pretext for **Hash Tables**. 

In [[C++]] or [[Java]], the arrays we've been using are static, reserving a known size chunk of memory.

However, we sometimes want a **dynamic** data structure (size is mutable). 

### The Pointer

Like a coordinate, numbers that point to a certain location on a map.

Pointer contains 'coordinates' to a location where a value is stored; could also be more coordinates.

location -> [[memory address]]

```
int var = 10;

int *ptr1;

int **ptr2;

ptr1 = &var;

ptr2 = &ptr1;
```

ptr2 -> memory location of ptr1
ptr1 -> memory location of var
var -> stores value in memory at a certain location

### Stack

>First in Last out

Linked List but only has the **head** pointer.

- Push -> insert at head
- Pop -> remove at head, return removed item

### Queue

>First in First out

Linked List but has only **head** and **tail** pointers.

- Dequeue -> remove at head, return removed item
- Enqueue -> add at tail
