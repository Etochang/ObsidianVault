## Heap Continued.

**Binary Tree** wrapped inside **1D Array**.

`A[1]` is the root, ditch `A[0]`. 

>[!example] Max-Heap Mafia
>Boss -> Underboss -> Capo -> Soldier
>
>Most money -> More money -> Less money -> Least money

Left child -> multiply parent by 2
Right child -> multiply parent by 2 add 1
Parent -> integer division by 2

**Max-Heapify**: sink the root to its proper position
	Prerequisite: both subtrees are max heaps already
	Maintains the property

**Verify from bottom up**!

**BuildHeap**: convert random array to heap array
	Creates a heap
	Call heapify on each index of array, from last to first
