## Asymptotic

- **Approaching** some behavior **at infinity**. 
- this term is used to measure the time & space cost of an algorithm.

## Time Complexity

Data comes in many sizes; a prime example is the spreadsheet.

Trying to relate the **data size N** with the **response time** for a program. 

### Worst Case

- **The Upper Bound** of running time

### The Best Case

- **The Lower Bound** of running time

### The "Average Case"

- 

### The Order of Growth

We care more about the complexity when N becomes very large.

We care less about the exact running time, but rather the **order of growth**. 

---
$$RunningTime(N) = t_1N^3+t_2N^2$$
**Order of Growth:**
$$N^3 + N^2$$

## Big-O Notation

### Definition

- If we find that there is a positive constant $c$, $n_0$ that makes the following true:$$\forall (n \ge n_0): 0 \le f(n) \le c \cdot g(n)$$then$$f(n) \ \mathcal{O}(g(n))$$
