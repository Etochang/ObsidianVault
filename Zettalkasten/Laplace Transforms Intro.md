# Laplace Transforms Intro

As we saw in the last [section](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/LaplaceDefinition.aspx) computing Laplace transforms directly can be fairly complicated. Usually we just use a [table of transforms](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Laplace_Table.aspx) when actually computing Laplace transforms. The table that is provided here is not an all-inclusive table but does include most of the commonly used Laplace transforms and most of the commonly needed formulas pertaining to Laplace transforms.

Before doing a couple of examples to illustrate the use of the table let’s get a quick fact out of the way.

>[!info]
>Given $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ then,
>$$\mathcal{L}\{af(t)+bg(t)\} = aF(s)+bG(s)$$
>for any constants $a$ and $b$.

In other words, we don't worry about constants and we don't worry about sums or differences of functions in taking Laplace transforms.
