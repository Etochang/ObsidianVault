## What is it‚ùî

- [[hardware description language|HDL]] used to describe [[digital systems]] and [[circuits]].
- Used for the design and verification of digital and mixed-signal systems, including both [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASICs]] and [[field-programmable gate array|FPGAs]].
- Supports a range of levels of abstraction, from [[structural]] to [[behavioral]].
- Used for both [[simulation-based design]] and [[synthesis-based design]].
- Used to describe digital circuits hierarchically, starting with the most basic elements such as [[logic gate|logic gates]] and [[flip-flop|flip-flops]] and building up to more complex functional blocks and systems. It also supports a range of modeling techniques, including [[gate-level modeling|gate-level]], [[RTL-level modeling|RTL-level]], and [[behavioral-level modeling]].
