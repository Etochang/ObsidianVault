# Imagining Your Reader's Role

> Your role as a researcher is established as: *I have information for you*; *I can help you fix a problem*; *I can help you understand something better*. You must, however, cast your readers in a complementary role by offering them a social contract: *I'll play my part if you play yours*.

title: Three Reasons to Read Research

### Entertain Me

They want to be amiably engaged and entertained, and while they still wnat you to be knowledgeable, they don't require rigorous authenticity of your claims.

### Help Me Solve My Practical Problem

They want a solution that is relevant to their problem, with all unnecessary bloat cut off. The authenticity is critical, but the source is not; solutions tend to be detail-oriented and false details lead to false claims, but a deep understanding of something is not required to be able to utilize it. 

### Help Me Understand Something Better

They want a holistic explanation of a concept with plenty of solid evidence to support it, as well as an explanation of why it matters in the existing realm of understanding.
