# C Syntax

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello World!");
	return 0;
}
```

`#include <stdio.h>` is a [[header file]] [[library]] that lets us work with input and output functions, such as `printf()`. They add functionality to C programs.

C ignores white space.

`main()` is always in every C program. This is called a function, and any code inside of the brackets will be executed.

`return 0;` ends the `main()` function.

## Statements

A [[program]] is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a [[programming language]], these instructions are called **statements**. The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Hello World" to the screen:

```
printf("Hello World");
```

Statements are executed sequentially, though there may be "jump" instructions that break the visual top-to-bottom sequence.
