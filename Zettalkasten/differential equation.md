# differential equation

A differential equation is any equation which contains **derivatives**, either ordinary derivatives or partial derivatives.

>[!example] Newton's Second Law is a differential equation
>$$F=ma$$
>To see that this is a differential equation, we need to remember that we can rewrite the acceleration, $a$, in two ways.
>$$a = \frac{dv}{dt} \ \ \textrm{OR} \ \ a = \frac{d^2u}{dt^2}$$ 
>Where $v$ is the velocity of the object and $u$ is the position function of the object at any time $t$. We should also remember at this point that the force, $F$, may also be a function of time, velocity, and/or position.
>
>So, with all these things in mind, we can write Newton's Second Law as
>$$m \frac{dv}{dt} = F(t,\ v)$$
>$$m \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = F(t,\ u,\ \frac{du}{dt})$$
