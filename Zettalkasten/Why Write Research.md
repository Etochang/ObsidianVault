# Why Write Research

> We write not just to share our work, but to improve it before we do.

### Write to Remember

When you don't take notes, whether it is in research paper form or flashcard form, it is easy to forget what you read.

### Write to Understand

Writing allows one to better utilize remembered information, as arranging a paper tests out many different interactions and relationships. 

### Write to Test Your Thinking

Writing allows one to objectively evaluate one's thoughts.
