# Polarization

*Polarization* is a characteristic of **all transverse waves**. To introduce some basic polarization concepts, let's go back to the transverse waves on a string in [[Waves & Acoustics#15. Mechanical Waves|Chapter 15]]. For a string that in equilibrium lies along the $x$-axis, the displacements may be along the $y$-direction.

In this case, the string always lies in the $xy$-plane. But the displacements might instead be along the $z$-axis:

Then, the string always lies in the $xz$-plane.

When a wave has only $y$-displacements, we say that it is **linearly polarized** in the $y$-direction; a wave with only $z$-displacements is linearly polarized in the $z$-direction. For mechanical waves, we can build a **polarizing filter**, or **polarizer**, that permits only waves with a certain polarization direction to pass.

In this figure, the string can slide vertically in the slot with no friction, but no horizontal motion is possible. This filter passes waves that are polarized in the $y$-direction but blocks those that are polarized in the $z$-direction.
