## Introduction
## Summary
### a. [[Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves]]

Maxwell's equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate in vacuum at the speed of light, $c$. The electromagnetic spectrum covers frequencies from at least 1 to $10^{24} \textrm{Hz}$ and a correspondingly broad range of wavelengths. Visible light, with wavelengths from 380 to 750 nm, is a very small part of this spectrum. In a plane wave, $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are uniform over any plane perpendicular to the propagation direction.  Faraday's law and Ampere's law give relationships between the magnitudes of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$.
$$E = cB$$
$$B = \epsilon_0 \mu_0 c E$$
Requiring that both relationships are satisfied gives an expression for $c$ in terms of $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ . 
$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}$$

### b. [[Plane Electromagnetic Waves and the Speed of Light]]

Electromagnetic waves are transverse; the $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation and to each other. The direction of propagation is the direction of $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ .

When an electromagnetic wave travels through a dielectric, the wave speed $v$ is less than the speed of light in vacuum $c$.
$$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{KK_m}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}= \frac{c}{\sqrt{KK_m}}$$
The index of refraction of a material $n$ is
$$n = \sqrt{KK_m}=\frac{c}{v}$$

### c. [[Sinusoidal Electromagnetic Waves]]

$$\vec{E}(x,\ t) = \hat{j}E_{max}\cos(kx-\omega t)$$
$$\vec{B}(x,\ t) = \hat{k}B_{max}\cos(kx-\omega t)$$
These equations describe a sinusoidal plane electromagnetic wave traveling in vacuum in the $+$x-direction. If the wave is propagating in the   $-$x-direction, replace $kx-\omega t$ with $kx + \omega t$ .
$$E_{max} = cB_{max}$$

### d. [[Energy and Momentum in Electromagnetic Waves]]

The energy flow rate (power per unit area) in an electromagnetic wave in vacuum is given by the Poynting vector $\vec{S}$ . 
$$\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}$$
The magnitude of the time-averaged value of the Poynting vector is called the intensity $I$ of the wave.
$$I = S_{av} = \frac{E_{max}B_{max}}{2\mu_0} = \frac{E_{max}^2}{2\mu_0 c} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0}{\mu_0}}E_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 c E_{max}^2$$
Electromagnetic waves also carry momentum. When an electromagnetic wave strikes a surface, it exerts a radiation pressure $p_{rad}$ . If the surface is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction and is totally absorbing, $p_{rad} = I/c$ ; if the surface is a perfect reflector, $p_{rad} = 2I/c$ .
$$\frac{1}{A} \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{S}{c} = \frac{EB}{\mu_0c} \ \textrm{(flow rate of momentum)}$$
