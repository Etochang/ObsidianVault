# hash table

aka **hash map** or **hash set**, a hash table is a [[data structure]] that implements an [[associative array]] (dictionary). A hash table uses a **hash function** to compute an *index* from a [[key]], and puts the [[value]] associated with the key at the index in the array. This **hash function** is also called during lookup.
