# Eddy Currents

In previous examples of induction effects, the induced currents have been confined to well-defined paths in conductors and other components forming a circuit. However, many pieces of electrical equipment contain masses of metal moving in magnetic fields or located in changing magnetic fields. In situations like these, we can have induce currents that circulate throughout the volume of a material. Because their flow patterns resemble swirling eddies in a river, we call these **eddy currents**.

>Consider a metallic disk rotating in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the disk but confined to a limited portion of the disk's area.

>Sector $Ob$ is moving across the field and has an emf induced in it. Sectors $Oa$ and $Oc$ are not in the field, but they provide return conducting paths for charges displaced along $Ob$ to return from $b$ to $O$. The result is a circulation of eddy currents in the disk, somewhat as sketched here.

We can use Lenz's law to decide on the direction of the induced current in the neighborhood of sector $Ob$. This current must experience a magnetic force that ***opposes*** the rotation of the disk, which means that it is easy to figure out the direction of the current with the right-hand rule.
