# variable

Generally, a variable is a storage location (identified by a [[memory address]]) paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), containing some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. 

The variable name is the way the programmer refers to the storage location in the code.

Each variable has a [[data type]] that defines the kind of data it can hold, such as integers, floats, characters, or other custom [[data type|data types]]. 

In most programming languages, you **declare** a variable before using it, specifying its [[data type]] and an optional initial value. Once declared, you can assign new values to the variable as the [[program]] executes.
