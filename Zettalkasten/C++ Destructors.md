# C++ Destructors

A destructor is a special [[class#Class Methods|member function]] that is called when the [[lifetime - C++|lifetime]] of an [[object]] ends, which includes
- [[program termination]], for objects with static [[storage duration]]
- [[thread]] exit, for objects with thread-local storage duration|(since C++11)
- end of [[scope]], for objects with automatic storage duration and for [[temporary|temporaries]] whose life was extended by binding to a [[C++ References|reference]]
- [[delete-expression]], for objects with dynamic storage duration
- end of the full [[expression]], for nameless [[temporary|temporaries]]
- [[stack unwinding]], for objects with automatic storage duration when an exception escapes their block, uncaught.

The purpose of the destructor is to free the resources that the [[object]] may have acquired during its [[lifetime - C++|lifetime]].

| **Syntax**                                                  | \#  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| ~ *class-name* ();                                          | (1) |
| **virtual** ~ *class-name* ();                              | (2) |
| *decl-specifier-seq* ﻿(optional) ~ *class-name* () = default; | (3) |
| *decl-specifier-seq* ﻿(optional) ~ *class-name* () = delete;  | (4)    |

1) Typical declaration of a prospective(since C++20) destructor.
2) Virtual destructor is usually required in a base class.
3) Forcing a destructor to be generated by the compiler.
4) Disabling the implicit destructor.
