# Writing as an Imagined Conversation

> Writing is an *imagined* conversation. Once we decide what role to play and what role to assign our readers, those roles are fixed. 

Readers judge writers as they read, writers judge readers as they write. Writers have to preemptively judge what their readers want and what roles the readers have.
