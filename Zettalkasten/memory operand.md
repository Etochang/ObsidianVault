# memory operand

Data that is not being used or stored in [[register|registers]] are stored in [[memory]]. Every [[processor]] must have data transfer [[instruction|instructions]] to move data from [[memory]] to a [[register]] and vice versa. In [[MIPS]], these [[instruction|instructions]] are `lw` and `sw`.

A memory operand is typically denoted using `[]`. For example, if you wanted to access the [[memory address]] `0x0001`, you would represent the memory operand as `[0x0001]`.
