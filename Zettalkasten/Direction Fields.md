# Direction Fields

This is a **direction field**. 

## Why do we care?

1. **Sketch of solutions**. Since the arrows in the direction fields are tangent to the actual solutions to the differential equations, we can use these as guides to sketch the graphs of solutions to the differential equation.
2. **Long Term Behavior**. In many cases we are less interested in the actual solutions as we are in how the solutions behave as $t$ increases. Direction fields can be used to find information about this long term behavior of the solution.

So let's go back to the example direction field. Let's say that we have an initial condition $v(0) = 30$. This is how we would draw that solution on the direction field:

To get a better idea of how all the solutions are behaving, lets draw a set of solutions on the direction field, called a **family of solution curves**.

## Sketching Direction Fields for First Order ODEs

$$y' = y-x$$
To sketch direction fields for this ode, we first identify places where the derivative will be constant. To do this, we set the derivative in the differential equation equal to a constant, say $c$. 
$$c = y-x$$ This gives us a family of equations, called **isoclines**, that we can plot and on each of these curves, the derivative will be a constant value of $c$.

The graph of these curves for several values of $c$ is shown below:
