# integrated circuit

An integrated circuit (IC) is a collection of electronic components (transistors, resistors, capacitors, diodes) fabricated on a small semiconductor material, which is usually silicon. The function of the IC depends on how it is designed, which could be literally anything - however, ICs can generally be differentiated into two categories:

## Analog

These work with continuous signals and are commonly used to  manipulate said signals. Some examples include:

- **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps):** Used for amplifying analog signals.
- **Comparators:** Compares two analog voltages and outputs a digital signal.
- **Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs):** Converts analog signals to digital for processing by digital systems.
- **Power Amplifiers:** Amplifies power signals for devices like speakers.
- **Voltage Regulators:** Maintains a stable voltage for electronic components.
- **Accelerometers:** Measures acceleration.
- **Gyroscopes:** Measures orientation.
- **Temperature Sensors, Pressure Sensors, etc.:** Measures environmental conditions.
- **Microphone and Audio ICs:** Processes and amplifies audio signals in devices like smartphones and audio equipment.

## Digital

These work with discrete signals ([[bit|bits]]). They are used in computers, microcontrollers, memory devices, and digital signal processors.

- **Microprocessors:** These are the central processing units (CPUs) of computers and other digital devices
- **Microcontrollers:** Microprocessors for embedded systems, usually with built-in memory and peripheral interfaces.
- **Memory ICs:**
	- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Provides temporary data storage for fast access by the processor.
	- **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Stores permanent data and instructions.
	- **Flash Memory:** Used for non-volatile storage, commonly found in USB drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives.
- **Digital Signal Processors (DSP):** Specialized microprocessors designed for processing digital signals, commonly used in audio and video processing.
- **Communication ICs:**
	- **Ethernet Controllers:** Enables network connectivity.
	- **Wireless Communication ICs (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular):** Include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular communication chips.
- **Interface ICs:**
	- **USB Controllers:** Manages USB connections.
	- **Display Drivers:** Controls the display of information on screens.
- **Clock and Timer ICs:** Generates clock signals and manages timing functions in electronic systems.
- **Logic ICs:**
	- **AND, OR, NOT Gates:** Basic building blocks of digital circuits.
	- **Flip-Flops, Latches:** Used in memory and storage circuits.
	- **Multiplexers, Demultiplexers:** Selects and routes signals.
