## Summary

### a. [[Electric Charge]]

The fundamental quantity in [[electrostatics]] is **electric charge**. There are two kinds of charge: *positive* and *negative*. Charges of the same sign repel, and charges of opposite sign attract. Charge is conserved - the total charge in an isolated system is constant.

All ordinary matter is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The positive protons and neutral neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are bound together by the nuclear force; the negative electrons surround the nucleus at distances much greater than the nuclear size. Electric interactions are chiefly responsible for the structure of atoms, molecules, and solids.

### b. [[Conductors, Insulators, and Induced Charges]]

Conductors are materials in which charge moves easily; in insulators, charge doesn't move easily. Most metals are good conductors; most nonmetals are insulators.

### c. [[Coulomb's Law]]

For charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$, the magnitude of the electric force on either charge is as follows:
$$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$
$$\frac{1}{r\pi\epsilon_0} = k = 8.988 \times 10^9 N\cdot m^2/C^2$$

The force on each charge is along the line joining the two charges, repulsive if they have the same sign, attractive if they have opposite signs. In SI units, the unit of electric charge is the **coulomb**, abbreviated as C. 

When two or more charges each exert a force on a charge, the total force on that charge is the vector sum of the forces exerted by the individual charges.
