## Introduction

## Summary

### a. [[Electric Charge]]

The fundamental quantity in [[electrostatics]] is **electric charge**. There are two kinds of charge: *positive* and *negative*. Charges of the same sign repel, and charges of opposite sign attract. Charge is conserved - the total charge in an isolated system is constant.

All ordinary matter is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The positive protons and neutral neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are bound together by the nuclear force; the negative electrons surround the nucleus at distances much greater than the nuclear size. Electric interactions are chiefly responsible for the structure of atoms, molecules, and solids.

### b. [[Conductors, Insulators, and Induced Charges]]

Conductors are materials in which charge moves easily; in insulators, charge doesn't move easily. Most metals are good conductors; most nonmetals are insulators.

### c. [[Coulomb's Law]]

For charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$, the magnitude of the electric force on either charge is as follows:
$$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$
$$\frac{1}{r\pi\epsilon_0} = k = 8.988 \times 10^9 N\cdot m^2/C^2$$

The force on each charge is along the line joining the two charges, repulsive if they have the same sign, attractive if they have opposite signs. In SI units, the unit of electric charge is the **coulomb**, abbreviated as C. 

When two or more charges each exert a force on a charge, the total force on that charge is the vector sum of the forces exerted by the individual charges.

### d. [[Electric Field and Electric Forces]]

Electric field $\vec{E}$ is the force per unit charge exerted on a text charge at any point.
$$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}_0}{q_0}$$
The electric field produced by a point charge is directed radially away from a positive charge and radially toward a negative charge. 
$$\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

### e. [[Electric Field Calculations]]

The electric field $\vec{E}$ of any combination of charges is the vector sum of the fields caused by the individual charges. To calculate the electric field caused by a continuous distribution of charge, divide the distribution into small elements, calculate the field caused by each element, and then carry out the vector sum, usually by integrating.

Charge distributions are described by linear charge density $\lambda$ , surface charge density $\sigma$ , and volume charge density $\rho$ .  

### f. [[Electric Field Lines]]

Field lines provide a graphical representation of electric fields. At any point on a field line, the tangent to the line is in the direction of $\vec{E}$ at that point.

The number of lines per unit area (perpendicular to their direction) is proportional to the magnitude of $\vec{E}$ at the point.

### g. [[Electric Dipoles]]

An electric dipole is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude $q$ but opposite sign, separated by a distance $d$ . The electric dipole moment $\vec{p}$ has magnitude $p = qd$ . The direction of $\vec{p}$ is from negative towards positive charge. 

An electric dipole in an electric field $\vec{E}$ experiences a torque $\vec{\tau}$ equal to the vector product of $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}$ . 
$$\tau = pE \sin{\phi}$$
The magnitude of the torque depends on the angle $\phi$ between $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}$ .
$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$$
The potential energy $U$ for an electric diploe in an electric field also depends on the relative orientation of $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}$ . 
$$U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}$$
