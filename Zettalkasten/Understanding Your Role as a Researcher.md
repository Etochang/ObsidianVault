# Understanding Your Role as a Researcher

> In true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. When you do research, you learn something that others don't know.

Your reader should be thought of as someone who doesn't know what you are researching but *needs to know*, and yourself should be thought as someone who will give the reader a reason to *want* to know it.
