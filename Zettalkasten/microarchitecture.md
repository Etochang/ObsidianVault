# microarchitecture

Also known as **computer architecture** or **CPU architecture**, microarchitecture is a lower-level description of the actual hardware implementation of the [[processor]] that is developed based off of a specific [[ISA]]. It involves defining how the CPU will execute [[instruction|instructions]] from the [[ISA]]. 

## Key Concepts

### 1. Registers:
- The size and actual method of usage is determined.
### 2. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
- This carries out arithmetic and logical operations.
### 3. Control Unit:
- Decodes [[instruction|instructions]] and controls the flow of data within the [[processor]].
### 4. Pipeline:
- Technique used to improve [[CPU]] performance by breaking down [[instruction]] execution into multiple stages.
### 5. Instruction Execution:
- Defines how each [[instruction]] is executed, and how they react with [[register|registers]] and [[memory]].
