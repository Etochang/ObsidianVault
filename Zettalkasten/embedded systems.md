# embedded systems

An **embedded system** is a [[computer system]] - consisting of a [[processor]], [[memory]], and I/O peripheral devices - that is dedicated to a **particular function** within a larger mechanical or electronic system. Because an embedded system usually controls physical functions of the larger system, they often have [[real-time computing]] constraints. 

They range from low (a single microcontroller chip) to very high (multiple units, peripherals, and networks connected via long-distance communication lines) complexity.

## Characteristics

In contrast to PCs and servers, embedded systems are designed for specific tasks. Depending on the task, embedded systems may have [[real-time computing]] constraints that must be met for safety and usability purposes, or they may have no constraints at all, allowing for system hardware to be simplified.

Embedded systems are not standalone. They can work in tandem with other embedded systems; they can provide specific functionality in a bigger embedded system that focuses on a single, higher-level task; usually, they are part of a larger system that has a more general purpose. 

The instructions written for embedded systems - the code/program - are called [[firmware]], and are stored in [[read-only memory|ROM]] chips. 

### User Interfaces

Embedded systems range from having no user interface at all to having complex [[GUI]]s. 

### Processors

- Low power consumption
- small size
- Rugged operating ranges
- low per-unit cost
