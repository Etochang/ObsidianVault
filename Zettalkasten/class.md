```ad-example
title: Car Analogy
Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. A car is an object. It has attributes, like color and weight, as well as methods, like drive and brake.

**Attributes** and **methods** are basically variables and functions that belong to the class. As such, they are referred to as **class members**.
```
### Creating a Class
```
class MyClass {          //The class
	public:              //access specifier
		int myNum;       //attribute (int)
		string MyString; //attribute (string)
};
```
```ad-info
title: Example Explained
- The `class` keyword is used to create a class called `MyClass`.
- The `public` keyword is an **access specifier**, which specifies that members of the class are accessible from outside the class.
- Inside the class, there is an integer variable `myNum` and a string variable `myString`. When variables are declared within a class, they are called **attributes**.
- At last, end the class definition with a **semicolon** `;`.
