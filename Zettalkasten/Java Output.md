# Java Output

## Double Quotes

Text must be wrapped inside double quotation marks `""`. 

>[!error]
>```
>System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
>```

## The print() Method

The only difference between the `print()` method and the `println()` method is that the former doesn't insert a newline at the end of the output.

## Numbers

Numbers can also be printed, but unlike text, they are not put inside double quotes:

>[!example]
>```
>System.out.println(3);
>```

Mathematical calculations can also be performed inside the `println()` method.

>[!example]
>```
>System.out.println(3 + 3);
>```
