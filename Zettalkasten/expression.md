An expression is a combination of symbols ([[operator|operators]] and [[operand|operands]]) that represents a value. Expressions are used to perform computations or evaluate to a particular value. They can be simple or complex, depending on the [[operation|operations]] involved.

In the example above, `a + b * c` is the expression.
