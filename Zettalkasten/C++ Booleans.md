# C++ Booleans

## Boolean Values

A Boolean variable is declared with the `bool` [[keyword]] and can only take the values `true` and `false`. 

## Boolean Expression

A **Boolean expression** returns a boolean value that is either `1` or `0`. This is useful to build logic and find answers. You can use a comparison operator, such as `>`, to find out if an expression (or variable) is true or false:

```
int x = 10;
int y = 9;
cout << (x > y); // returns 1, because 10 > 9
```
