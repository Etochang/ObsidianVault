# The DevOps Essentials - The Handbook

## What is DevOps

- A software engineering culture that unifies development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams
- Goal is shorter development cycles
- DevOps is **not**:
	- a set of tools, it is a culture, movement, and philosophy
		- Not Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, DevOps is the cause
	- a standard
	- a product
	- 
- By practitioners, for practitioners
-
