# The DevOps Essentials - The Handbook

## What is DevOps

- A software engineering culture that unifies development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams
- Goal is shorter development cycles
- DevOps is **not**:
	- a set of tools, it is a culture, movement, and philosophy
		- Not Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, DevOps is the cause
	- a standard
	- a product
	- 
- By practitioners, for practitioners

## Dev and Ops Teams - Their Targets

Traditional:
- Dev-Team
	- Deliver features quickly
	- Goal is speed
- Ops-Team
	- Maintain stability
- in opposition to each other

DevOps:
- One Team
	- Deliver features quickly
	- Maintain stability
	- Goal is speed
	- Shared Goals = Shared Accountability
		- Time to Market: time to develop and deploy to customers
		- Minimizing Production failures
		- Immediate Recovery from failures

## History

- DevOps spawned from Agile
	- Small frequent cycles of development vs. Waterfall's long planning phases

## What Happened in Silos

Traditional:
- Silos
	- Separated teams that have walls inbetween them
	- Dev, QA, Ops
	- Dev Code → QA
		- responsibility gone until code returns
	- QA → Ops
		- responsibility gone until code goes back to Dev
	- No cross-team visibility: "black box"
	- lengthy deployment

 DevOps:
- Dev Code → Automated Builds, Integration, Testing, Deployment
- Test while new features are being developed
- Automated Monitoring detects issues, rollback deployments

## Build Automation

- Automation of preparing code for deployment to a live environment
